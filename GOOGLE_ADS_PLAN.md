    -   **Phone Calls (from Website):** Tracked via GTM and dynamic number insertion.
    -   **Email Clicks:** Clicks on `mailto:` links.
    -   **Tracking Page Visits:** Users checking an order status.

### GA4 Integration

-   Link Google Ads to Google Analytics 4 (GA4).
-   Import GA4 conversions (e.g., `generate_lead`) into Google Ads.
-   Build audiences in GA4 (e.g., "Engaged Users," "High-Value Customers") and import them into Google Ads for remarketing.

## 6. Budget & Bidding Strategy

-   **Initial Budget:** Recommend starting with **£50-£100 per day**, focusing on the bottom-funnel search campaigns first.
-   **Bidding Strategy:**
    -   **Initial Phase (1-2 weeks):** Start with **Maximize Clicks** to gather data.
    -   **Growth Phase (Post-data collection):** Switch to **Maximize Conversions** with a Target CPA (Cost Per Acquisition) goal.
    -   **Mature Phase:** Implement **Target ROAS** (Return On Ad Spend) if conversion values are accurately tracked.

## 7. Targeting

-   **Geographic:**
    -   **Primary:** Hamilton, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Motherwell, East Kilbride.
    -   **Secondary:** Target a 20-mile radius around Hamilton.
-   **Language:** English
-   **Demographics:** Monitor performance by age, gender, and income, but do not apply exclusions initially.

## 8. Remarketing Strategy

-   **All Visitors (30 days):** A general remarketing campaign with brand-focused messaging.
-   **Booking Abandoners (7 days):** A more aggressive campaign with a special offer or urgency messaging (e.g., "Complete Your Booking!").
-   **Past Customers (180 days):** A campaign to encourage repeat business, potentially with a loyalty discount.

## 9. Measurement & Reporting (GA4)
