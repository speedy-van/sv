## 📊 How Earnings Are Calculated

### Formula:
```
Per Drop Earnings = Total Route Value / Total Drops
Adjusted Earnings = Per Drop Earnings × Completed Drops
```

### Example:
```
Route Value: £100
Total Drops: 10
Completed Drops: 6

Per Drop Earnings = £100 / 10 = £10
Adjusted Earnings = £10 × 6 = £60

Driver receives £60 (only for completed drops)
```

## 🔄 Real-Time Update Flow

### When Route is Removed:

1. **Admin Action** → Remove route via UI
2. **Backend Processing:**
   - Calculate completed drops
   - Recalculate earnings
   - Update database
   - Update driver availability

3. **Real-Time Notifications:**
   ```
   Pusher Event: 'route-unassigned' → Admin Channel
   Pusher Event: 'route-removed' → Driver Channel
   Pusher Event: 'schedule-updated' → Driver Schedule
   Pusher Event: 'schedule-updated' → Admin Schedule
   ```

4. **Platform Updates:**
   - ✅ Admin dashboard refreshes route list
   - ✅ Admin earnings panel updates
   - ✅ Driver portal updates schedule

## 💻 Frontend Integration

### Driver Portal (React/Next.js)
```typescript
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import Pusher from 'pusher-js';

// In driver dashboard
useEffect(() => {
  const pusher = new Pusher(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY!, {
    cluster: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER!
  });

  const channel = pusher.subscribe(`driver-${driverId}`);

  // Listen for route removal
  channel.bind('route-removed', (data: any) => {
    toast({
      title: 'Route Removed',
      description: data.message,
      status: 'warning',
      duration: 8000
    });
    
    // Refresh schedule and earnings
    loadSchedule();
    loadEarnings();
  });

  // Listen for schedule updates
  channel.bind('schedule-updated', (data: any) => {
    loadSchedule();
  });

  return () => {
    channel.unbind_all();
    pusher.unsubscribe(`driver-${driverId}`);
  };
}, [driverId]);
```

### iOS Driver App (Swift)
```swift
import PusherSwift

// Subscribe to driver channel
let pusher = Pusher(
    key: "YOUR_PUSHER_KEY",
    options: PusherClientOptions(
        cluster: "eu"
    )
)

let channel = pusher.subscribe("driver-\(driverId)")

// Route removed event
channel.bind(eventName: "route-removed") { (event: PusherEvent) -> Void in
    if let data: [String: Any] = event.data {
        let completedDrops = data["completedDrops"] as? Int ?? 0
        let totalDrops = data["totalDrops"] as? Int ?? 0
        let earnedAmount = data["earnedAmount"] as? Int ?? 0
        let message = data["message"] as? String ?? ""
        
        // Show local notification
        showNotification(
            title: "Route Removed",
            body: message,
            data: ["earnedAmount": earnedAmount]
        )
        
        // Update UI
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            self.reloadSchedule()
            self.reloadEarnings()
        }
    }
}

// Schedule update event
channel.bind(eventName: "schedule-updated") { (event: PusherEvent) -> Void in
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        self.reloadSchedule()
    }
}
```

## 🔍 Database Changes

### DriverEarnings Update:
```sql
UPDATE DriverEarnings
SET 
  netAmountPence = [adjusted_amount],
  adminAdjustedAmountPence = [adjusted_amount],
  adminAdjustedBy = '[admin_id]',
  adminAdjustedAt = NOW(),
  adminNotes = 'Route cancelled - Adjusted to 6/10 completed drops. Reason: Van breakdown'
WHERE id = '[earning_id]'
```

### Route Update:
```sql
UPDATE Route
SET 
  status = 'pending_assignment',
  driverId = NULL,
  updatedAt = NOW()
WHERE id = '[route_id]'
```

### Driver Availability Update:
```sql
UPDATE DriverAvailability
SET 
  currentCapacityUsed = currentCapacityUsed - [removed_count],
  status = 'offline'  -- For safety when removing all
WHERE driverId = '[driver_id]'
```

## 🛡️ Safety & Audit

### Audit Trail:
- ✅ All removals logged with reason
- ✅ Admin ID recorded in earnings adjustments
- ✅ Timestamp of all changes
- ✅ Original vs adjusted amounts stored
- ✅ Completed drops vs total drops recorded

### Data Integrity:
