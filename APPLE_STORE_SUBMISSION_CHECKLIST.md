## üéØ Common Rejection Reasons & How We Avoid Them

### 1. ‚ùå "Location permission not justified"
**Our Answer:**
> "Background location is essential for real-time customer tracking during active deliveries. Customers expect to see driver's live position and ETA throughout their delivery. Location is only tracked during active jobs, not 24/7. This is clearly explained in our permission request."

‚úÖ **Already Fixed:** Clear permission descriptions in `app.json`

---

### 2. ‚ùå "Demo account doesn't work"
**Prevention:**
- Test account daily before submission
- Ensure backend is stable
- Add test routes to account if needed

‚úÖ **Action:** Test the account NOW before submitting

---

### 3. ‚ùå "App crashes on launch"
**Prevention:**
- Test on real iOS device
- Use TestFlight with beta testers
- Check crash logs in Xcode

‚úÖ **Recommendation:** Deploy to TestFlight first (optional but safer)

---

### 4. ‚ùå "Missing required legal links"
**Prevention:**
- Privacy Policy accessible
- Terms & Conditions accessible
- Support page functional

‚úÖ **Already Fixed:** All pages created and live

---

### 5. ‚ùå "App doesn't match screenshots"
**Prevention:**
- Use REAL screenshots from actual app
- No mockups or edited images
- Show actual app content

‚úÖ **Action Required:** Take screenshots from real device/simulator
