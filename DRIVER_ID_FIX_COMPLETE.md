# Driver ID Mapping Fix - Complete Report

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Branch:** fix-routes-and-deepseek  
**Status:** ✅ **ALL ISSUES FIXED**

---

## Problem Summary

**Root Cause:** Multiple files were using `driver.userId` instead of `driver.id` when assigning drivers to routes and bookings, causing foreign key constraint violations.

**Database Schema:**
```prisma
model Booking {
  driverId String?
  driver   Driver? @relation(fields: [driverId], references: [id])
  // driverId must reference Driver.id, NOT Driver.userId
}

model Route {
  driverId String?
  driver   Driver? @relation(fields: [driverId], references: [id])
  // driverId must reference Driver.id, NOT Driver.userId
}

model Driver {
  id     String @id @default(cuid())
  userId String @unique
  User   User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}
```

**The Relationship:**
- `Booking.driverId` → `Driver.id` ✅
- `Route.driverId` → `Driver.id` ✅
- `Driver.userId` → `User.id` ✅

**NOT:**
- `Booking.driverId` → `Driver.userId` ❌
- `Route.driverId` → `Driver.userId` ❌

## Files Fixed

### 1. `/apps/web/src/app/api/admin/routes/route.ts` (Line 244)

**Before:**
```typescript
const drivers = driversData.map((driver: any) => ({
  id: driver.userId,  // ❌ Wrong!
  name: driver.User?.name || 'Unknown',
  status: driver.DriverAvailability?.status || 'offline',
  currentRoutes: 0,
}));
```

**After:**
```typescript
const drivers = driversData.map((driver: any) => ({
  id: driver.id,  // ✅ Fixed!
  name: driver.User?.name || 'Unknown',
  status: driver.DriverAvailability?.status || 'offline',
  currentRoutes: 0,
}));
```

**Impact:** This fix resolves the reassign driver function error. The frontend now receives correct driver IDs.

### 2. `/apps/web/src/app/api/admin/routes/multi-drop/route.ts` (Line 221)

**Before:**
```typescript
const route = await prisma.route.create({
  data: {
    driverId: driver.userId,  // ❌ Wrong!
    vehicleId,
    startTime: new Date(startTime),
    // ...
  },
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
const route = await prisma.route.create({
  data: {
    driverId: driver.id,  // ✅ Fixed!
    vehicleId,
    startTime: new Date(startTime),
    // ...
  },
});
```

**Impact:** Multi-drop route creation now uses correct driver ID, preventing foreign key violations.

### 3. `/apps/web/src/lib/services/analytics-service-v2.ts` (Line 248)

**Before:**
```typescript
return {
  driverId: driver.userId,  // ❌ Wrong!
  driverName: driver.User?.name || 'Unknown Driver',
  totalBookings,
  totalRevenue,
  // ...
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
return {
  driverId: driver.id,  // ✅ Fixed!
  driverName: driver.User?.name || 'Unknown Driver',
  totalBookings,
  totalRevenue,
  // ...
};
```

**Impact:** Analytics service now returns correct driver IDs for reporting and dashboard displays.

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Reassign Driver
**Route:** `booking-cmgrlviom0005w21oprll6hw8`  
**From:** Ahmed Mohammeds  
**To:** Mohamad Albashir (ID: `cmg0pd1x5007mkz29sv031923`)  
**Result:** ✅ **SUCCESS** - Status 200 OK

**Before Fix:**
```
POST /api/admin/routes/.../reassign 500 (Internal Server Error)
Error: Foreign key constraint violated: Booking_driverId_fkey
```

**After Fix:**
```
POST /api/admin/routes/.../reassign 200 in 2496ms
✅ Driver Reassigned Successfully
```

### Test Case 2: Multi-Drop Route Creation
**Status:** ✅ Ready for testing (fix applied)

### Test Case 3: Analytics Dashboard
**Status:** ✅ Ready for testing (fix applied)
