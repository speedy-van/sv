## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: URLs return 404
**Solution:** Ensure web app is deployed and running
```bash
# Check if web app needs redeployment
cd apps/web
pnpm run build
```

### Issue: Test account doesn't work
**Solution:** Verify in database and ensure backend is running
- Check: https://speedy-van.co.uk/api/health
- Login manually via web: https://speedy-van.co.uk/driver/login

### Issue: Build fails
**Solution:** Clear cache and rebuild
```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile production --clear-cache
```

### Issue: Screenshots wrong size
**Solution:** Use native simulator, don't resize
- Must use exact device simulators
- Capture with Cmd+S in simulator
- No manual resizing allowed
