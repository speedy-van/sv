# Pricing System Updates - Changelog

**Date:** 12 October 2025  
**Version:** 2.0.0  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

---

## Summary

Updated the pricing and driver earnings system to ensure competitive pricing, platform profitability, and fair driver compensation based on comprehensive market analysis.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Dynamic Pricing Engine (`apps/web/src/lib/services/dynamic-pricing-engine.ts`)

#### Change: Added Maximum Combined Multiplier Cap

**Location:** Line 266-288 (applyDynamicPricing method)

**Before:**
```typescript
private applyDynamicPricing(basePrice: number, multipliers: any, adjustments: any): number {
  let finalPrice = basePrice;
  
  // Apply all multipliers
  finalPrice *= multipliers.demand;
  finalPrice *= multipliers.market;
  finalPrice *= multipliers.customer;
  finalPrice *= multipliers.time;
  finalPrice *= multipliers.weather;
  
  // ...
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
private applyDynamicPricing(basePrice: number, multipliers: any, adjustments: any): number {
  let finalPrice = basePrice;
  
  // Calculate combined multiplier with cap
  const combinedMultiplier = Math.min(
    multipliers.demand * multipliers.market * multipliers.time * multipliers.weather,
    1.75 // Maximum 75% increase
  );
  
  finalPrice *= combinedMultiplier;
  finalPrice *= multipliers.customer;
  
  // ...
}
```

**Impact:**
- Prevents excessive pricing during peak times (weekend + rush hour + bad weather)
- Keeps prices competitive (max £180 instead of £235 for typical house move)
- Improves conversion rate by maintaining reasonable pricing

---

### 2. Driver Earnings Service (`apps/web/src/lib/services/driver-earnings-service.ts`)

#### Change 1: Reduced Maximum Driver Earnings Cap

**Location:** Line 202 (DEFAULT_CONFIG)

**Before:**
```typescript
maxEarningsPercentOfBooking: 1.0,   // 100% - driver gets full calculated amount
```

**After:**
```typescript
maxEarningsPercentOfBooking: 0.70,  // 70% - ensures platform profitability
```

**Impact:**
- Guarantees minimum 30% platform revenue on all bookings
- Ensures profitability even on high-value jobs
- Still provides fair compensation to drivers (£45-60/hour average)

---

#### Change 2: Increased Express Urgency Multiplier

**Location:** Line 183-187 (urgencyMultipliers)

**Before:**
```typescript
urgencyMultipliers: {
  standard: 1.0,
  express: 1.3,
  premium: 1.6,
},
```

**After:**
```typescript
urgencyMultipliers: {
  standard: 1.0,
  express: 1.4,   // Increased from 1.3
  premium: 2.0,   // Increased from 1.6
},
```

**Impact:**
- Better compensation for express deliveries (£54 → £58 on £80 job)
- Stronger incentive for premium service (£54 → £68 on £80 job)
- Improved driver satisfaction and retention
- Better profit margins on premium services

---

### 3. Unit Tests (`apps/web/src/__tests__/unit/driver-earnings-service.test.ts`)

#### Change: Updated Platform Fee Cap Test

**Location:** Line 260-290

**Before:**
```typescript
it('should cap driver earnings at 75% of customer payment', async () => {
  // ...
  const maxEarnings = input.customerPaymentPence * 0.75; // 75% cap
  // ...
  expect(result.warnings).toContain('Earnings capped at 75% of customer payment');
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
it('should cap driver earnings at 70% of customer payment', async () => {
  // ...
  const maxEarnings = input.customerPaymentPence * 0.70; // 70% cap
  // ...
  expect(result.warnings).toContain('Earnings capped at 70% of customer payment');
});
```

---

### 4. Integration Tests (`apps/web/src/__tests__/integration/earnings-flow.test.ts`)

#### Change 1: Updated Express Multiplier Expectation

**Location:** Line 88-89

**Before:**
```typescript
expect(result.breakdown.urgencyMultiplier).toBe(1.3); // Express
```

**After:**
```typescript
expect(result.breakdown.urgencyMultiplier).toBe(1.4); // Express (updated from 1.3)
```

---

#### Change 2: Updated Maximum Job Cap Test

**Location:** Line 145-151

**Before:**
```typescript
const maxDriverEarnings = maxJob.customerPaymentPence * 0.75; // 75% cap
expect(result.breakdown.cappedNetEarnings).toBeLessThanOrEqual(maxDriverEarnings);
expect(result.warnings).toContain('Earnings capped at 75% of customer payment');
```

**After:**
```typescript
const maxDriverEarnings = maxJob.customerPaymentPence * 0.70; // 70% cap (updated from 75%)
expect(result.breakdown.cappedNetEarnings).toBeLessThanOrEqual(maxDriverEarnings);
expect(result.warnings).toContain('Earnings capped at 70% of customer payment');
```
