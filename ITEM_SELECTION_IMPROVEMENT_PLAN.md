# Organized Image Selection Implementation Plan for Booking Step 3

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of an organized image selection system for step 3 of the booking process, integrating with the existing `/public/items/` directory structure.

## 1. Planning and Structure

### Current State Analysis

- **Existing Images**: 50+ item images in `/public/items/`
- **Current Component**: `EnhancedItemSelectionStep.tsx` with category-based selection
- **Integration Point**: Step 3 of 9-step booking flow

### Target Structure

```
/public/items/
├── furniture/
│   ├── sofa.png
│   ├── chair.png
│   ├── table.png
│   └── bed.png
├── appliances/
│   ├── refrigerator.png
│   ├── washer.png
│   ├── dryer.png
│   └── dishwasher.png
├── electronics/
│   ├── tv.png
│   ├── computer.png
│   └── printer_scanner.png
├── boxes/
│   ├── large-box.png
│   ├── medium-box.png
│   └── small-box.png
└── misc/
    ├── bicycle.png
    ├── bbq_grill.png
    └── other.png
```

## 2. Image Organization

### Categorization Strategy

## 8. Technical Implementation

### Component Structure

```typescript
// New components to create:
-ImageGallery.tsx -
  ImageGrid.tsx -
  ImageCard.tsx -
  CategoryFilter.tsx -
  SearchBar.tsx -
  SelectionPanel.tsx -
  ImageModal.tsx -
  UploadZone.tsx;
```

### Data Management

```typescript
// Types and interfaces:
interface ItemImage {
  id: string;
  path: string;
  category: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  tags: string[];
  dimensions: { width: number; height: number };
}

interface ImageSelection {
  itemId: string;
  quantity: number;
  customNotes?: string;
}
```

### API Integration

- RESTful endpoints for image metadata
- Search and filter APIs
- Upload endpoints for custom images
- Analytics tracking for usage patterns
