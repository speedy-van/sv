3. Run `eas build:configure` again

### Issue: "No provisioning profile found"
**Solution**:
```bash
eas credentials --clear-cache
eas credentials
```
Select iOS > Production > Create new provisioning profile

### Issue: "Submission failed"
**Solution**:

### Issue: Build succeeds but app crashes on device
**Solution**:
1. Check capabilities match in both app.json and Apple Developer
2. Verify all required permissions are in Info.plist
3. Review build logs for warnings

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use `--auto-submit` flag**: Automatically submit to TestFlight after build
   ```bash
   eas build --platform ios --profile production --auto-submit
   ```

2. **Monitor builds**: Check https://expo.dev for real-time logs

3. **Test on real devices**: Use TestFlight for testing, not just simulator

4. **Version management**: EAS auto-increments build numbers

5. **Keep credentials secure**: EAS stores credentials securely in their vault

6. **Build locally** (optional): Use `eas build --local` if you prefer
