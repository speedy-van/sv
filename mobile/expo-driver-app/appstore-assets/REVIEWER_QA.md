# Apple App Store Reviewer Q&A

**Quick Reference Guide for Common Reviewer Questions**

---

## ‚ùì Common Questions & Perfect Answers

### Q1: "Why does your app need 'Always' location permission?"

**APPROVED ANSWER:**
```
Background location is essential for our delivery service's core functionality:

1. CUSTOMER SAFETY & TRANSPARENCY
   Customers track their driver's real-time location during active deliveries
   for security and peace of mind, similar to Uber/Deliveroo.

2. ACCURATE ETA CALCULATIONS
   Live positioning enables precise arrival time estimates, improving
   service quality and customer satisfaction.

3. DRIVER SAFETY
   GPS tracking provides accountability and protection for drivers
   during deliveries, especially when working alone.

4. ROUTE OPTIMIZATION
   Real-time location allows efficient multi-drop route planning,
   reducing fuel costs and delivery times.

IMPORTANT: Location tracking is ONLY active during accepted delivery jobs,
NOT 24/7. When offline or without active deliveries, tracking is paused.

This is clearly explained in our permission dialog and Privacy Policy.

### Q2: "Can you demonstrate the location feature working?"

**TESTING STEPS:**
```
1. Login with test account (zadfad41@gmail.com / 112233)
2. Go to "Routes" tab
3. Accept an available route (if none, contact us for test data)
4. Tap "Start Route"
5. You'll see:
   - Live map with your location marker
   - Customer can see this same view via tracking link
   - Location updates every 10 seconds
6. Complete delivery ‚Üí location tracking stops
```

### Q3: "Why does the app need camera access?"

**APPROVED ANSWER:**
```
Camera access is essential for:

1. PROOF OF DELIVERY
   Drivers photograph delivered items/locations as evidence of
   successful delivery (industry standard practice).

2. CUSTOMER PROTECTION
   Photo documentation protects both customer and driver in case
   of delivery disputes.

3. PROFILE PHOTO
   Optional: Drivers can upload a profile photo for
   customer recognition.

Camera is only used when driver explicitly taps "Take Photo" button.
No background camera usage or automatic photo capture.
```

---

### Q4: "What happens if location services are disabled?"

**APP BEHAVIOR:**
```
If location is disabled:
1. App shows clear warning modal: "Location Required"
2. Explains why location is needed
3. Provides button to open Settings
4. Driver cannot start deliveries until location is enabled
5. App does NOT crash or freeze

This is a safety requirement - deliveries cannot proceed without
customer tracking capability.
```
