# 🚀 Speedy Van Driver v2.0.0 - Android Deployment Guide

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE

**This is a React Native/Expo app** - The SAME codebase works for both iOS and Android!

The issue with Android v1.0.0 is that it's an **old build** that doesn't include the latest updates. Since this is a cross-platform app, all the new features, UI improvements, and bug fixes are **already compatible with Android** - we just need to create a new build.

## 📊 Current Status

|----------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| **iOS** | 1.0.0 | 2.0.0 | ✅ **Latest code** |
| **Android** | 1.0.0 | 2.0.0 | ⏳ **Needs build** |

**The code is ready - we just need to build and deploy!**
