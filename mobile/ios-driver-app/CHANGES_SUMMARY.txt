KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
-------------------------
✅ Push Notification → In-App Flow
   - Reliable in-app alerts
   - View Now navigation
   - Accept with retry logic
   - Telemetry logging

✅ Driver Progress Line (State Machine)
   - Strict forward-only transitions
   - No loops, no skipping states
   - Actionable error messages
   - Offline support

✅ Backend API Integration
   - Idempotent accepts
   - Exponential backoff retry
   - Correlation IDs for tracing
   - Enhanced error handling

✅ Reliability & Telemetry
   - No silent failures
   - Full request/response logging
   - State transition logging
   - Crash prevention

TESTING REQUIRED:
-----------------
□ Unit tests for JobStateMachine
□ Unit tests for NotificationHandler
□ UI tests for notification flow
□ UI tests for progress line
□ Manual QA on real devices
□ Offline mode testing
□ Flaky network testing
□ Duplicate tap testing

BACKEND REQUIREMENTS:
---------------------
□ POST /api/driver/notifications/log (NEW)
□ POST /api/driver/jobs/:id/accept (UPDATE - add idempotency)
□ POST /api/driver/routes/:id/accept (UPDATE - add idempotency)
□ PUT /api/driver/jobs/:id/progress (UPDATE - add validation)
□ Database migrations for telemetry and idempotency

DEPLOYMENT PLAN:
----------------
1. Backend implements required endpoints (1-2h)
2. iOS testing on staging (2-4h)
3. Cut hotfix build and submit to TestFlight (4-6h)
4. Monitor production metrics (24-48h)

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
--------------------
✅ 99.5%+ success rate push → view → accept
✅ Zero crash rate
✅ No orphaned or skipped states
✅ All endpoints observable
✅ Idempotent writes verified

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Backend team implements required endpoints
2. QA team runs test plan
3. Fix any issues found
4. Cut hotfix build
5. Deploy to TestFlight
6. Monitor production

STATUS: READY FOR TESTING
