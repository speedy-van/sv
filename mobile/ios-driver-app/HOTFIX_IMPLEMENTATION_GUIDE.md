# iOS Driver App - Critical Hotfix Implementation Guide

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** IMMEDIATE HOTFIX  
**Priority:** CRITICAL

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the immediate hotfix implementation to address critical failures in the iOS driver app, specifically:

1. **Push Notification → In-App Flow** for route/order alerts
2. **Driver Progress Line (State Machine)** with strict validation
3. **Backend API Integration** with idempotency and retry logic
4. **Reliability, Telemetry, and Error Handling**

All fixes have been implemented and are ready for testing and deployment.

---

## 1. Push Notification → In-App Flow

### ✅ Implemented Components

#### **NotificationHandler.swift** (NEW)
- **Location:** `/Services/NotificationHandler.swift`
- **Purpose:** Manages push notification → in-app alert flow
- **Features:**
  - Parses incoming push notifications
  - Displays in-app alert overlay
  - Handles "View Now" and "Accept" actions
  - Implements idempotent accept with exponential backoff retry (3 attempts)
  - Logs all notification events for telemetry
  - Prevents duplicate notification processing

#### **InAppNotificationView.swift** (NEW)
- **Location:** `/Views/Notifications/InAppNotificationView.swift`
- **Purpose:** UI for in-app notification alerts
- **Features:**
  - Modal overlay with gradient header
  - "View Now" button → navigates to route/order screen
  - "Accept" button → accepts job/route with loading state
  - "Dismiss" button → closes alert
  - 30-second auto-dismiss countdown
  - Smooth animations and transitions

#### **AppDelegate.swift** (UPDATED)
- **Changes:**
  - Integrated `NotificationHandler` for foreground notifications
  - Integrated `NotificationHandler` for notification tap handling
  - Removed duplicate navigation logic

#### **SpeedyVanDriverApp.swift** (UPDATED)
- **Changes:**
  - Added `NotificationHandler` as `@StateObject`
  - Added overlay for in-app notification alerts
  - Passed `NotificationHandler` to environment

### 🔄 Notification Flow

```
Push Notification Arrives
    ↓
AppDelegate receives notification
    ↓
NotificationHandler.handlePushNotification()
    ↓
Parse payload (type, entityId, title, message)
    ↓
Show InAppNotificationView overlay
    ↓
User taps "View Now" or "Accept"
    ↓
NotificationHandler.handleNotificationAction()
    ↓
For "Accept": Retry logic with idempotency
    ↓
Navigate to appropriate screen
    ↓
Log telemetry event
```

### 📊 Telemetry Events Logged

- `received` - Notification received
- `action_view_now` - User tapped View Now
- `action_accept` - User tapped Accept
- `action_dismiss` - User dismissed alert

---

## 2. Driver Progress Line (State Machine)

### ✅ Implemented Components

#### **JobStateMachine.swift** (NEW)
- **Location:** `/Services/JobStateMachine.swift`
- **Purpose:** Enforces strict forward-only state transitions
- **Features:**
  - Validates all state transitions
  - Prevents invalid transitions (no loops, no skipping)
  - Returns actionable error messages
  - Calculates progress percentage per state
  - Local state persistence for offline support
  - Offline queue for state transitions
  - Syncs queued transitions when online

#### **State Transition Rules**

```swift
available → assigned
assigned → accepted
accepted → enRoute
enRoute → arrived
arrived → loading
loading → inTransit
inTransit → unloading
unloading → completed
completed → [TERMINAL]
cancelled → [TERMINAL]
```

**No backward transitions allowed. No skipping states.**

#### **TrackingViewModel.swift** (UPDATED)
- **Changes:**
  - Integrated `JobStateMachine` for validation
  - Validates transitions before API calls
  - Saves state locally after successful updates
  - Queues transitions for offline sync on network errors
  - Shows actionable error messages for invalid transitions

### 🔒 State Validation Example

```swift
// Current state: enRoute
// User tries to skip to inTransit (invalid)

stateMachine.canTransition(from: .enRoute, to: .inTransit)
// Returns: false

stateMachine.getTransitionErrorMessage(from: .enRoute, to: .inTransit)
// Returns: "Cannot transition from En Route to In Transit. 
//           Allowed next states: Arrived"
```

### 💾 Offline Support

- State changes saved locally via `UserDefaults`
- Failed transitions queued for sync when online
- Queued transitions include correlation IDs
- Automatic retry on network restoration

---

## 3. Backend API Integration

### ✅ Enhanced NetworkService

#### **NetworkService.swift** (UPDATED)
- **Changes:**
  - Added `headers` parameter for custom headers (e.g., `Idempotency-Key`)
  - Added `retryCount` and `maxRetries` for automatic retry logic
  - Exponential backoff with jitter (2^n + random 0-1 seconds)
  - Automatic retry for network errors (max 3 attempts)
  - Automatic retry for 502, 503, 504 server errors
  - Correlation ID (`X-Correlation-ID`) added to all requests
  - Enhanced error handling with actionable messages

#### **Idempotency Implementation**

```swift
// Example: Accept job with idempotency key
let idempotencyKey = "accept_\(jobId)_\(notificationId)"

let response: JobActionResponse = try await network.request(
    .acceptJob(id: jobId),
    method: .post,
    body: request,
    headers: ["Idempotency-Key": idempotencyKey]
)
```

**Backend must:**
- Store idempotency keys with TTL (24-48 hours)
- Return same response for duplicate keys
- Prevent duplicate job assignments

#### **AppConfig.swift** (UPDATED)
- **Changes:**
  - Added `logNotificationEvent` endpoint

### 📡 Required Backend Endpoints

#### **Existing (Must Support Idempotency)**
- `POST /api/driver/jobs/:id/accept` - Accept job
- `POST /api/driver/routes/:id/accept` - Accept route
- `PUT /api/driver/jobs/:id/progress` - Update job progress

#### **New (Must Implement)**
- `POST /api/driver/notifications/log` - Log notification events

**Request Schema:**
```json
{
  "notificationId": "uuid",
  "type": "new_job|job_update|new_route|route_update",
  "entityId": "job-123",
  "event": "received|action_view_now|action_accept|action_dismiss",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-18T12:00:00Z",
  "metadata": {
    "title": "New Job Available",
    "message": "From London to Manchester"
  }
}
```

## 4. Reliability, Telemetry, and Error Handling

### ✅ Implemented Features

#### **Exponential Backoff + Jitter**
- Base delay: 2^n seconds (2s, 4s, 8s)
- Jitter: Random 0-1 seconds added
- Max retries: 3 attempts
- Applied to network errors and 502/503/504 server errors

#### **Correlation IDs**
- UUID generated for each request
- Sent as `X-Correlation-ID` header
- Enables end-to-end tracing: app → gateway → service → DB

#### **Error Surfaces**
- Actionable error messages shown to user
- No silent failures
- Error messages include:
  - What went wrong
  - What the user can do
  - Which states are allowed

#### **Crash Prevention**
- All async operations wrapped in do-catch
- Network errors handled gracefully
- State validation prevents invalid transitions
- Duplicate notification processing prevented

#### **Logging & Breadcrumbs**
- Request/response logging (debug mode)
- State transition logging
- Notification event logging
- Retry attempt logging
- Correlation IDs for tracing

Authorization: Bearer <token>
Idempotency-Key: accept_job-123_notif-456
X-Correlation-ID: uuid
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "idempotencyKey": "accept_job-123_notif-456"
}
```

**Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Job accepted successfully"
}
```

**Response (Already Accepted - Same Idempotency Key):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Job already accepted"
}
```

**Response (Error - Different Driver Already Accepted):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "This job has already been accepted by another driver"
}
```

#### 3. POST /api/driver/routes/:id/accept (Update Required)
**Same as above, but for routes**

#### 4. PUT /api/driver/jobs/:id/progress (Update Required)
**Must support:** State transition validation on backend

```json
{
  "step": "arrived",
  "notes": "Optional notes",
  "latitude": 51.5074,
  "longitude": -0.1278
}
```

**Backend Validation:**
- Verify current job state
- Verify transition is valid (use same state machine rules)
- Return 400 if invalid transition

**Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Progress updated",
  "data": {
    "step": "arrived",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-18T12:00:00Z"

**Response (Invalid Transition):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Cannot transition from en_route to in_transit. Must go to arrived first."
}
```

## 10. Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Notification payload parsing** assumes specific field names (`type`, `entityId`, `jobId`, `routeId`)
   - Backend must send notifications with these fields
2. **Offline sync** is basic - queued transitions are not automatically retried
   - Future enhancement: background sync on app resume
3. **No notification history** - dismissed notifications are not stored
   - Future enhancement: notification center with history

### Edge Cases Handled
- ✅ Duplicate notification processing prevented
- ✅ Network errors retry with backoff
- ✅ Invalid state transitions blocked
- ✅ Offline state changes queued
- ✅ Idempotent accepts prevent double-booking

### Edge Cases Not Handled (Future Work)
- ⚠️ Notification arrives while in-app alert already showing
  - Current: New notification replaces old one
  - Future: Queue multiple notifications
- ⚠️ User force-quits app during state transition
  - Current: Transition may be lost if not yet queued
  - Future: Persist pending transitions immediately
