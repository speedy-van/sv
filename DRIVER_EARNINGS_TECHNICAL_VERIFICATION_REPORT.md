```typescript
const subtotal = Math.round(
  (baseFare + perDropFee + mileageFee + timeFee) *
  urgencyMultiplier *
  serviceTypeMultiplier *
  performanceMultiplier
);
```

This matches documentation:
```
Subtotal = (Base + Drops + Mileage + Time) × Urgency × Service × Performance
```

## 4. API Integration Verification

### ✅ Admin Assignment Endpoint

**File:** `apps/web/src/app/api/admin/routes/[id]/assign/route.ts`

**Status:** ✅ Properly integrated but uses route's `driverPayout` field

```typescript
// Line 328
totalEarnings: result.updatedRoute.driverPayout ? 
  Number(result.updatedRoute.driverPayout) : 0
```

**How it works:**
1. Admin assigns route to driver
2. Route already has `driverPayout` calculated (from route creation)
3. Push notification sent to iOS app with `totalEarnings`
4. Driver sees estimated earnings in app

**⚠️ Note:** The route's `driverPayout` should be calculated using `calculateRouteEarnings()` during route creation.

### ✅ Driver Completion Endpoint

**File:** `apps/web/src/app/api/driver/jobs/[id]/complete/route.ts`

**Status:** ✅ FULLY INTEGRATED with DriverEarningsService

```typescript
// Line 247-272
const { driverEarningsService } = await import(
  '@/lib/services/driver-earnings-service'
);

const earningsResult = await driverEarningsService.calculateEarnings({
  assignmentId: assignment.id,
  driverId: driver.id,
  bookingId: jobId,
  distanceMiles: computedDistanceMiles,
  durationMinutes: totalMinutes,
  dropCount: computedDropCount,
  customerPaymentPence: booking.totalGBP,
  urgencyLevel: booking.urgency,
  onTimeDelivery: computedSlaDelayMinutes <= 0,
  // ... additional parameters
});
```

**Flow:**
1. Driver completes job
2. System calculates **actual** earnings based on:
   - Actual distance driven
   - Actual time taken
   - Customer rating (if available)
   - On-time delivery status
3. Earnings saved to `DriverEarnings` table
4. Payout scheduled for next payment cycle

### ✅ Earnings Preview Endpoint

**File:** `apps/web/src/app/api/routes/[id]/earnings-preview/route.ts`

**Status:** ✅ Uses dedicated route earnings calculation

```typescript
// Line 22
const earnings = await calculateRouteEarnings(routeId);
```

**Function:** `calculateRouteEarnings()` (Line 680-746 in driver-earnings-service.ts)
- Calculates earnings for each booking in route
- Applies multi-drop bonus
- Returns total estimated earnings

---

## 5. iOS App Impact Analysis

### 📱 What iOS App Receives

#### A) Route Assignment Notification:

**Payload Structure:**
```typescript
{
  routeId: string,
  bookingId: string,          // iOS primary ID
  orderId: string,            // iOS fallback ID
  assignmentId: string,
  
  // Route metadata
  type: 'multi-drop' | 'single-order',
  routeNumber: string,
  orderNumber: string,
  
  // Counts
  bookingsCount: number,
  dropsCount: number,
  
  // Route details
  totalDistance: number,      // in km
  estimatedDuration: number,  // in minutes
  totalEarnings: number,      // ⚠️ from route.driverPayout (in pence)
  
  // ... other fields
}
```

**Source:** Line 328 in `/api/admin/routes/[id]/assign/route.ts`

#### B) Job Details Endpoint:

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/driver/jobs/[id]`

**Response:**
```typescript
{
  job: {
    id: string,
    reference: string,
    // ... job details
    
    driverPayout: number,        // Net earnings in pence
    pricing: {
      driverPayout: number,      // In GBP (£)
      driverPayoutPence: number, // In pence
      estimatedEarnings: number, // In GBP (£)
      currency: 'GBP',
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

**Source:** Lines 225-232 in `/api/driver/jobs/[id]/route.ts`

### ⚠️ iOS App Integration Status

**Current Implementation:**
1. ✅ iOS app receives estimated earnings when route is assigned
2. ✅ Earnings calculated using DriverEarningsService
3. ⚠️ Assignment payload uses `route.driverPayout` (pre-calculated)
4. ✅ Job details endpoint calculates earnings on-demand
5. ✅ Completion endpoint calculates actual earnings

**Consistency Check:**
- **Route Assignment:** Uses `route.driverPayout` field (static value)
- **Job Details:** Calculates earnings dynamically using DriverEarningsService
- **Job Completion:** Calculates earnings dynamically using DriverEarningsService

### 🔄 Recommendation for iOS App:

**Option 1: Keep Current Implementation** ✅ RECOMMENDED
- Route assignment shows pre-calculated earnings from `route.driverPayout`
- Job details and completion use real-time calculation
- **Pros:** Fast, efficient, no additional API calls
- **Cons:** Estimated earnings might differ slightly from final

**Option 2: Add Real-Time Calculation** (Not necessary)
- Calculate earnings in real-time during assignment
- **Pros:** 100% accuracy
- **Cons:** Slower, more API load, minimal benefit

**Verdict:** Current implementation is optimal. iOS app doesn't need updates.
