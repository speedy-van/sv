## 🎯 Smart Route Generator Integration

### How It Works:

**Scenario:** Admin creates route for 6 bookings

```
1. Admin: Smart Route Generator
   ↓
2. Selects 6 pending bookings
   ↓
3. Chooses driver assignment:
   - Auto: System picks John Driver (least busy)
   - Manual: Admin selects Mike Driver
   - None: Route pending_assignment
   ↓
4. Clicks "Confirm & Create Routes"
   ↓
5. Backend creates:
   - Route: RTXXXXXXXX
   - 6 Drop records
   - Updates: 6 bookings → CONFIRMED
   - Assigns: Driver (if selected)
   ↓
6. Pusher sends notification:
   Channel: driver-{johnId}
   Event: route-assigned
   Data: {
     routeId: 'RTXXXXXXXX',
     stops: 6,
     totalValue: 40396,
     message: 'New multi-drop route assigned!'
   }
   ↓
7. iOS App receives:
   - Push notification appears
   - Badge count updates
   - Route appears in "My Routes"
   - Driver can view details
   ↓
8. Driver actions:
   - Accept → Route active
   - Decline → Route unassigned
   - View → See all 6 drops
   - Navigate → Start route
```
