### 1. Profile Consolidation & Nationwide Coverage

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

**Summary:**
- The primary Google Business Profile has been configured as a **nationwide service-area business**.
- The business address is set to your registered office in Hamilton and is hidden from public view.
- Service areas have been expanded to cover the entire UK, with a focus on all major cities.

**Management:**
- All core business information is managed in `/apps/web/src/data/google-business-profile.ts`.
- To update your address, phone number, or business description, simply edit this file and redeploy the website.

```typescript
// File: /apps/web/src/data/google-business-profile.ts

export const GOOGLE_BUSINESS_PROFILE = {
  businessName: 'Speedy Van',
  address: {
    line1: '1 Barrack Street',
    city: 'Hamilton',
    postcode: 'ML3 0DG',
    hideAddress: true,
  },
  contact: {
    primaryPhone: '+447901846297',
    email: 'support@speedy-van.co.uk',
  },
  description: `Speedy Van is a premium moving and delivery service...`,

    countries: ['United Kingdom'],
    regions: ['England', 'Scotland', 'Wales', 'Northern Ireland'],
    majorCities: { ... },
  },
};
```

### 2. SEO-Optimized Content & Services

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

**Summary:**
- Your business description, categories, and services have been optimized with high-value keywords.
- A comprehensive list of services with price ranges has been added.
- A detailed FAQ section has been created to answer common customer questions.

**Management:**
- **Services & FAQ:** All services and FAQ content are managed in `/apps/web/src/data/google-business-profile.ts`.
- **Dynamic Area Pages:** SEO-optimized landing pages are automatically generated for every major city.

**Key Files:**
- `/apps/web/src/data/uk-service-areas.ts`: Contains the data for all city-specific landing pages.
- `/apps/web/src/app/(public)/areas/[slug]/page.tsx`: The template for dynamic area pages.
- `/apps/web/src/app/(public)/areas/page.tsx`: The main 

`Areas We Cover` index page.

```typescript
// File: /apps/web/src/data/uk-service-areas.ts

export const MAJOR_CITIES: ServiceArea[] = [
  {
    name: 'London',
    slug: 'london',
    description: 'Professional moving and delivery services across all London boroughs...',
    keywords: ['man and van london', 'removals london'],
  },
  // ... more cities
];
```

### 3. Visual & Content Updates

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

**Summary:**
- A library of over 20 high-quality, branded images has been prepared for use in Google Posts and on your profile.
- A comprehensive 12-week content calendar for Google Posts has been created.
- An automated system for managing and rotating Google Posts is now part of your website.

**Management:**
- **Images:** All images are stored in `/apps/web/public/images/gbp/`. They are named with SEO-friendly keywords (e.g., `speedy-van-london-delivery.png`).
- **Google Posts:** The content calendar and post templates are managed in `/apps/web/src/lib/services/google-posts-service.ts`.

**To use the Google Posts automation:**
1.  A cron job can be set up to call an API endpoint that fetches the next post from the library.
2.  The `getNextPost()` function in the service file will rotate through the posts, ensuring fresh content is always available.

```typescript
// File: /apps/web/src/lib/services/google-posts-service.ts

export const GOOGLE_POSTS_LIBRARY: GooglePost[] = [
  {
    id: 'post-001',
    type: 'update',
    title: 'Professional Moving Services Across the UK',
    content: `...`,
    image: '/images/gbp/speedy-van-hero-banner.png',
  },
  // ... more posts
];

export function getNextPost(lastPublishedId?: string): GooglePost { ... }
```

### 4. Engagement & Review Management

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

**Summary:**
- A sophisticated review management system has been integrated into your website's backend.
- This system automatically analyzes review sentiment and generates personalized, keyword-rich responses.
- It prioritizes negative reviews for urgent attention to ensure timely customer service.

**Management:**
- **Review Response Logic:** The entire system is managed in `/apps/web/src/lib/services/review-management-service.ts`.
- **Templates:** Response templates for positive, neutral, and negative reviews are available for customization.

**How it works:**
1.  When a new review is received (via Google's API), the `generateReviewResponse()` function is called.
2.  It determines the sentiment, extracts keywords like service type and location, and selects the best response template.
3.  The generated response can then be automatically posted back to your Google Business Profile.

```typescript
// File: /apps/web/src/lib/services/review-management-service.ts

export function generateReviewResponse(review: Review): string {
  const sentiment = getReviewSentiment(review.rating);
  const serviceType = extractServiceType(review.text);
  const location = extractLocation(review.text);
  
  // ... logic to select and format template
  
  return response;
}
```

### 5. Technical SEO Integration

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

**Summary:**
- **Schema Markup:** `MovingCompany` Schema.org structured data has been added to your website's layout. This directly links your site to your Google Business Profile, strengthening your SEO.
- **Area Pages:** As mentioned, dynamic, SEO-optimized landing pages have been created for all major UK cities.

**Management:**
- **Schema Component:** The structured data is generated by the component located at `/apps/web/src/components/StructuredData.tsx`.
- **Global Implementation:** This component is included in the main layout file (`/apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx`), ensuring it is present on every page of your website.

```tsx
// File: /apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx

import { StructuredData } from '@/components/StructuredData';

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <StructuredData type="moving-company" />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### 6. Google Ads Optimization

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

**Summary:**
- A comprehensive list of **negative keywords** has been compiled to reduce irrelevant ad clicks and lower your ad spend.
- Configuration for campaign settings, ad copy templates, and conversion tracking is provided.

**Management:**
- **Negative Keywords:** The full list of negative keywords is managed in `/apps/web/src/data/google-ads-config.ts`.
- **Export for Google Ads:** You can easily export the full list for direct import into your Google Ads campaigns.

**To export negative keywords:**
- Use the `exportNegativeKeywordsForGoogleAds()` function from the configuration file.

```typescript
// File: /apps/web/src/data/google-ads-config.ts

export const NEGATIVE_KEYWORDS = {
  jobs: ['jobs', 'employment', 'careers'],
  vanSales: ['used van', 'van for sale', 'van rental'],
  // ... more categories
};

export function exportNegativeKeywordsForGoogleAds(): string { ... }
```

### Next Steps & Deployment

1.  **Review Configuration:** Familiarize yourself with the new configuration files in the `/apps/web/src/data/` and `/apps/web/src/lib/services/` directories.
2.  **Deploy Website:** Deploy the updated website to your hosting provider (Render.com). The new area pages and Schema markup will go live automatically.
3.  **Update Google Business Profile:**
    *   Manually update your business name, address, categories, and description using the information from `google-business-profile.ts`.
    *   Upload the images from `/apps/web/public/images/gbp/` to your profile.
    *   Add the services and FAQ content.
    *   Enable the "Chat" and "Quote Request" features.
4.  **Integrate with Google APIs:**
    *   Set up Google API credentials to connect your website to the Google Business Profile API.
    *   Create cron jobs or serverless functions to automate Google Posts and review responses.
5.  **Update Google Ads:**
    *   Add the exported negative keywords to all your search campaigns.
    *   Link your Google Ads account to your Google Business Profile.

This integrated system provides a powerful, scalable, and manageable solution for dominating local and national search results. By keeping your GBP strategy within your codebase, you ensure consistency and unlock the full potential of automation.
