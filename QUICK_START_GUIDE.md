# Multi-Drop Routes Enhancement - Quick Start Guide

## Overview

This guide will help you quickly get started with the enhanced multi-drop routes system. Follow these steps to deploy and test the new features.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- PostgreSQL database access with admin privileges
- Node.js and pnpm installed
- Access to the admin panel
- iOS development environment (for iOS app updates)

## Step 1: Database Migration (5-10 minutes)

### Option A: Quick Migration (Recommended)

Run the essential migrations only:

```sql
-- Add essential Route columns
ALTER TABLE "Route" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "isModifiedByAdmin" BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE "Route" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "acceptanceStatus" TEXT DEFAULT 'pending';
ALTER TABLE "Route" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "optimizationAlgorithm" TEXT;

-- Add essential Drop columns
ALTER TABLE "Drop" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "sequenceInRoute" INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE "Drop" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "estimatedArrival" TIMESTAMP;

-- Add essential indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS "idx_route_status_date" ON "Route"("status", "startTime");
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS "idx_drop_route_sequence" ON "Drop"("routeId", "sequenceInRoute");
```

### Option B: Full Migration

Follow the complete instructions in `DATABASE_MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for all features.

## Step 2: Update Dependencies (2-3 minutes)

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/sv
pnpm install
```

## Step 3: Generate Prisma Client (1 minute)

```bash
cd packages/shared
npx prisma generate
```

## Step 4: Build the Application (3-5 minutes)

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/sv
pnpm build
```

If you encounter TypeScript errors, check the error messages and fix any type mismatches.

## Step 5: Test Backend APIs (5 minutes)

### Test Multi-Drop Route Creation

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/routes/multi-drop \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "drops": [
      {
        "customerId": "user_123",
        "pickupAddress": "123 Main St",
        "deliveryAddress": "456 Oak Ave",
        "timeWindowStart": "2025-10-20T09:00:00Z",
        "timeWindowEnd": "2025-10-20T17:00:00Z",
        "quotedPrice": 1500
      }
    ],
    "serviceTier": "standard",
    "autoOptimize": true
  }'
```

### Test Force Status Change

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/admin/routes/ROUTE_ID/force-status \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "status": "active",
    "reason": "Testing force status change"
  }'
```

### Test Route Analytics

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/routes/ROUTE_ID/analytics \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## Step 6: Test Admin Panel (5 minutes)

1. **Navigate to Admin Routes**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/admin/routes`
   - Verify the routes list loads

2. **View Route Details**
   - Click on any route
   - Verify all tabs load (Drops, Timeline, Notes, Analytics)

3. **Test Force Status Change**
   - Click "Actions" → "Force Change Status"
   - Select a new status and provide a reason
   - Click "Change Status"
   - Verify the status updates

4. **Test Driver Reassignment**
   - Click "Actions" → "Reassign Driver"
   - Select a driver from the dropdown
   - Click "Reassign"
   - Verify the driver updates

5. **Test Analytics**
   - Click "Actions" → "Load Analytics"
   - Verify analytics data displays in the Analytics tab

## Step 7: Update iOS App (10-15 minutes)

### Update Xcode Project

1. Open the iOS project in Xcode:
   ```bash
   cd /home/ubuntu/sv/mobile/ios-driver-app
   open ios-driver-app.xcodeproj
   ```

2. Build the project (⌘+B)

3. Fix any compilation errors if they appear

4. Run on simulator or device (⌘+R)

### Test iOS Features

1. **Fetch Routes**
   - Open the app
   - Navigate to Routes screen
   - Verify routes load with new fields

2. **View Route Details**
   - Tap on a route
   - Verify all information displays correctly
   - Check earnings display

3. **Accept/Decline Route**
   - Test route acceptance
   - Test route decline with reason

4. **Complete Drops**
   - Start a route
   - Complete drops one by one
   - Verify status updates

## Step 8: Test Bulk Operations (5 minutes)

### Using the API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/routes/bulk \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "operation": "changeStatus",
    "routeIds": ["route_1", "route_2", "route_3"],
    "data": {
      "status": "cancelled",
      "reason": "Testing bulk cancellation"
    }
  }'
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Database Migration Fails

**Solution**: Check PostgreSQL logs and ensure you have sufficient privileges.

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-*.log
```

### Issue 2: TypeScript Errors During Build

**Solution**: Check for missing type definitions or incorrect imports.

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/sv
pnpm tsc --noEmit
```

### Issue 3: API Returns 401 Unauthorized

**Solution**: Ensure you're using a valid admin token in the Authorization header.

### Issue 4: iOS App Doesn't Compile

**Solution**: Clean build folder and rebuild.

```bash
# In Xcode
Product → Clean Build Folder (⌘+Shift+K)
Product → Build (⌘+B)
```

### Issue 5: Analytics Don't Load

**Solution**: Verify the route has completed drops and sufficient data.
