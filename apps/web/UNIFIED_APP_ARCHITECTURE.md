# Unified App Architecture - Speedy Van

## Overview

This document describes the unified application architecture for Speedy Van, implementing a single application with role-based routing and shared components.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Single Application, Multiple Roles
- **Unified Codebase**: All user roles (admin, driver, customer) exist within a single Next.js application
- **Role-based Routing**: Each role has dedicated routes (`/admin/*`, `/driver/*`, `/customer/*`)
- **Shared Components**: Common UI components and utilities are shared across all roles
- **Single Deployment**: One deployment serves all user types

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

#### User Roles
- **Admin**: Full system access, user management, analytics
- **Driver**: Job management, earnings tracking, profile management
- **Customer**: Booking management, payment tracking, support

#### Route Structure
```
/admin/*          - Admin portal routes
/driver/*         - Driver portal routes  
/customer/*       - Customer portal routes
/auth/*           - Authentication routes
/api/*            - API routes (role-protected)
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Unified Routing System

**File**: `src/lib/routing.ts`

```typescript
export const ROUTES = {
  // Admin routes
  ADMIN: {
    DASHBOARD: '/admin',
    USERS: '/admin/users',
    BOOKINGS: '/admin/bookings',
    // ...
  },
  
  // Driver routes
  DRIVER: {
    DASHBOARD: '/driver',
    JOBS: '/driver/jobs',
    EARNINGS: '/driver/earnings',
    // ...
  },
  
  // Customer routes
  CUSTOMER: {
    DASHBOARD: '/customer',
    BOOKINGS: '/customer/bookings',
    PROFILE: '/customer/profile',
    // ...
  }
};
```

### 2. Middleware Implementation

**File**: `src/middleware.ts`

- **Route Protection**: Automatically protects routes based on user role
- **Authentication Check**: Verifies JWT tokens for protected routes
- **Role Validation**: Ensures users can only access their role-specific routes
- **Redirect Logic**: Redirects unauthorized users to appropriate login pages

### 3. Layout System

#### Unified Layouts
Each role has a dedicated layout file:
- `src/app/admin/layout.tsx` - Admin portal layout
- `src/app/driver/layout.tsx` - Driver portal layout  
- `src/app/customer/layout.tsx` - Customer portal layout

#### Shared Components
- `UnifiedNavigation` - Role-aware navigation component
- `UnifiedErrorBoundary` - Role-specific error handling
- `UnifiedShell` - Common layout wrapper

### 4. Component Architecture

#### Shared Components (`src/components/shared/`)
- **UnifiedNavigation**: Adapts navigation based on user role
- **UnifiedErrorBoundary**: Role-specific error handling
- **Common UI Components**: Buttons, cards, forms, etc.

#### Role-Specific Components
- **Admin Components**: `src/components/admin/`
- **Driver Components**: `src/components/driver/`
- **Customer Components**: `src/components/customer/`

### 5. Authentication Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Login] --> B{Authentication}
    B -->|Success| C{Check Role}
    C -->|Admin| D[/admin]
    C -->|Driver| E[/driver]
    C -->|Customer| F[/customer]
    B -->|Failure| G[/auth/login]
    D --> H[Admin Dashboard]
    E --> I[Driver Dashboard]
    F --> J[Customer Dashboard]
```
