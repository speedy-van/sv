# Customer Settings Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the Customer Settings functionality as specified in the cursor tasks.

## Overview

The Customer Settings page provides a comprehensive interface for customers to manage their account settings, including profile information, notification preferences, security settings, and privacy controls.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Profile Management

- **Full Name**: Editable name field
- **Email Address**: Editable email with verification status indicator
- **Email Verification**: Visual indicator showing if email is verified
- **Auto-save**: Updates are saved immediately when the "Save Profile" button is clicked

### 2. Notification Preferences

- **Email Notifications**: Toggle for receiving booking updates via email
- **SMS Notifications**: Toggle for receiving booking updates via SMS
- **Push Notifications**: Toggle for real-time browser notifications
- **Persistent Settings**: Preferences are saved and restored on page load

### 3. Security Features

- **Password Change**: Secure password change with current password verification
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**:
  - QR code generation for authenticator apps
  - TOTP verification
  - Backup codes generation
  - Enable/disable functionality
- **Password Requirements**: Minimum 8 characters with confirmation

### 4. Privacy & Data Controls

- **Data Export Request**: GDPR-compliant data export functionality
- **Account Deletion Request**: GDPR-compliant account deletion request
- **Privacy Policy Link**: Direct link to privacy policy

## API Endpoints

### Main Settings Endpoint

- `GET /api/customer/settings` - Retrieve all settings
- `PATCH /api/customer/settings` - Update settings

### Security Endpoints

- `PATCH /api/customer/settings/password` - Change password
- `POST /api/customer/settings/2fa` - 2FA setup/verification/disable

### Legacy Endpoints (Maintained for Backward Compatibility)

- `PATCH /api/customer/settings/profile` - Update profile
- `PATCH /api/customer/settings/notifications` - Update notifications

## Data Model

The settings functionality uses the existing User model with the following fields:

- `name`: User's full name
- `email`: User's email address
- `emailVerified`: Email verification status
- `twoFactorSecret`: 2FA secret key
- `backupCodes`: Array of backup codes
- `backupCodesGenerated`: Whether backup codes have been generated

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: All endpoints require valid customer session
2. **Password Security**:
   - Current password verification required
   - Minimum 8 character requirement
   - Secure hashing with bcrypt
3. **2FA Security**:
   - TOTP-based authentication
   - Secure secret generation
   - Backup codes for account recovery
4. **Data Protection**:
   - GDPR-compliant data export/deletion requests
   - Secure handling of personal information

## UI/UX Features

1. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive grid layout
2. **Loading States**: Skeleton loading and loading indicators
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and toast notifications
4. **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
5. **Visual Feedback**: Success/error states, verification badges, and status indicators

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite covering:

- Component rendering
- User interactions
- API integration
- Error handling
- Loading states
- 2FA functionality

## Dependencies

- `otplib`: TOTP-based 2FA implementation
- `qrcode`: QR code generation for 2FA setup
- `bcryptjs`: Password hashing
- `@chakra-ui/react`: UI components
- `@testing-library/react`: Testing utilities

## Future Enhancements

1. **Notification Preferences Model**: Create dedicated model for storing notification preferences
2. **Session Management**: Add active sessions list and management
3. **Language/Timezone Settings**: Add localization preferences
4. **Advanced Security**: Add login history and suspicious activity detection
5. **Data Export Implementation**: Complete GDPR data export functionality
6. **Account Deletion Workflow**: Implement complete account deletion process

## Usage

Customers can access the settings page at `/customer-portal/settings` after logging in. The page provides an intuitive interface for managing all account settings with clear sections for different types of settings.

## Compliance

The implementation follows GDPR requirements for:

- Right to data portability (data export)
- Right to erasure (account deletion)
- Transparency in data processing
- User consent management
