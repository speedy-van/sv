# Ratings, Incidents & Performance Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the Ratings, Incidents & Performance features for the Speedy Van Driver Portal, as specified in cursor_tasks.md section 12.

## Overview

The implementation provides a comprehensive feedback loop system that includes:

- Customer ratings and reviews for drivers
- Driver incident reporting system
- Performance metrics and analytics
- Admin management tools

## Database Schema

  - `status` (active, hidden, removed)
  - `customerId` (optional for internal tracking)

#### DriverIncident

- **Purpose**: Tracks incidents reported by drivers
- **Key Fields**:
  - `type` (vehicle_breakdown, traffic_accident, customer_dispute, etc.)
  - `severity` (low, medium, high, critical)
  - `title` and `description`
  - `location` and coordinates
  - `photoUrls` (array of photo URLs)
  - `status` (reported, under_review, resolved, closed, escalated)
  - Impact flags (customerImpact, propertyDamage, injuryInvolved)

#### DriverPerformance

- **Purpose**: Calculated performance metrics for drivers
- **Key Fields**:
  - `averageRating` and `totalRatings`
  - `completionRate`, `acceptanceRate`, `onTimeRate`, `cancellationRate`
  - Job counts (total, completed, cancelled, late)
  - Monthly rolling averages
  - `lastCalculated` timestamp

### New Enums Added

- `RatingCategory`: overall, communication, punctuality, care, professionalism

## API Endpoints

### Driver Portal APIs

#### GET /api/driver/performance

- Includes calculated metrics, recent ratings, and incidents
- Automatically creates performance record if none exists
- Calculates real-time metrics from assignment data

#### GET /api/driver/incidents

- Returns all incidents reported by the driver
- Includes job details and status information

#### POST /api/driver/incidents

- Allows drivers to submit new incident reports
- Validates required fields and assignment ownership
- Creates audit log entries
- Supports photo URLs, location data, and impact flags

### Customer APIs

#### POST /api/booking-luxury/[id]/rate

- Allows customers to rate completed jobs
- Validates booking status and prevents duplicate ratings
- Supports different rating categories
- Creates audit log entries

### Admin APIs

#### GET /api/admin/performance

- Returns performance data for all drivers or specific driver
- Includes ratings, incidents, and assignment history
- Supports filtering by driver ID

#### PUT /api/admin/performance

- Allows admins to moderate ratings and review incidents
- Updates status and adds moderation notes
- Creates audit log entries for all actions

## Frontend Components

### Driver Performance Page (`/driver/performance`)

- **Performance Overview**: Cards showing key metrics (rating, completion rate, acceptance rate, on-time rate)
- **Monthly Performance**: Rolling 30-day metrics
- **Recent Ratings**: Display of recent customer ratings with star ratings and reviews
- **Incidents Section**: List of reported incidents with status badges
- **Report Incident Modal**: Form for submitting new incident reports

### RatingForm Component

- Reusable component for customer rating submission
- Interactive star rating system
- Category selection and optional review text
- Form validation and error handling

## Key Features

### Performance Metrics Calculation

- **Average Rating**: Calculated from active ratings only
- **Completion Rate**: (completed jobs / claimed jobs) × 100
- **Acceptance Rate**: (claimed jobs / offered jobs) × 100
- **Cancellation Rate**: (cancelled jobs / total jobs) × 100
- **On-Time Rate**: Placeholder implementation (95% for completed jobs)

### Incident Reporting

- **Comprehensive Form**: Type, severity, description, location, impact flags
- **Photo Support**: Array of photo URLs (implementation for file upload needed)
- **Status Tracking**: From reported to resolved with admin review
- **Audit Trail**: All actions logged with timestamps

### Rating System

- **5-Star Scale**: 1-5 star ratings with hover effects
- **Categories**: Overall, communication, punctuality, care, professionalism
- **Moderation**: Admin can hide/remove inappropriate ratings
- **Duplicate Prevention**: One rating per customer per job

### Admin Management

- **Driver Overview**: Performance comparison across all drivers
- **Rating Moderation**: Hide/remove ratings with notes
- **Incident Review**: Update status, add notes, mark as resolved
- **Audit Logging**: Complete trail of all admin actions

## Testing

### Test Data Script

- `scripts/create-test-ratings.ts` creates sample ratings and incidents
- Generates realistic test data for development and testing
- Can be run multiple times safely

### Sample Data Created

- 5 ratings across different categories (4.6 average)
- 2 incidents (vehicle breakdown, weather delay)
- Performance metrics automatically calculated

## Integration Points

### Dashboard Integration

- Updated `/api/driver/dashboard` to use real performance data
- Rating display now shows actual calculated average
- Performance metrics integrated into KPI cards

### Navigation

- Added "Performance" link to driver portal navigation
- Accessible from main driver portal header

## Security & Compliance

### Access Control

- All driver APIs require driver authentication
- Admin APIs require admin role
- Customer rating API is public but validates booking ownership

### Data Privacy

- Customer IDs are optional in ratings for internal tracking
- Personal data is minimized in incident reports
- Audit logs track all actions for compliance

### Audit Trail

- All rating submissions logged
- All incident reports logged
- All admin moderation actions logged
- Complete history maintained for compliance

## Future Enhancements

### Photo Upload

- Implement file upload for incident photos

- Support multiple photo uploads

### Advanced Analytics

- Trend analysis over time
- Performance benchmarking
- Predictive analytics for driver performance

### Notification System
