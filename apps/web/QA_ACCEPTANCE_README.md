# QA & Acceptance Testing - Admin Dashboard

This document outlines the comprehensive QA & Acceptance testing implementation for the Speedy Van Admin Dashboard, following the requirements specified in the cursor tasks.

## Overview

The QA & Acceptance testing suite ensures that the admin dashboard meets all performance, security, and functional requirements before production deployment.

## Test Suites

### 1. Admin Dashboard Acceptance Tests (`admin-dashboard-acceptance.spec.ts`)

**Purpose**: End-to-end testing of core admin dashboard functionality

**Key Test Scenarios**:

- ✅ **Dashboard KPIs under 1 second TTI**
- ✅ **Filter 10k orders and bulk assign with atomic success**
- ✅ **Approve driver → can claim jobs; suspend → cannot**
- ✅ **Issue partial refund → Stripe webhook sync → finance view updated**
- ✅ **Change pricing → new quotes reflect version after `effectiveAt`**
- ✅ **Role-based access control enforcement**
- ✅ **Real-time updates and performance**
- ✅ **Audit trail and compliance**

### 2. Admin Dashboard Performance Tests (`admin-performance.spec.ts`)

**Purpose**: Performance benchmarking and optimization validation

**Performance Targets**:

- Dashboard load time: < 1 second TTI
- List interactions: < 100ms
- Map load time: < 2 seconds with 200 markers
- Real-time updates: < 100ms perceived
- Bulk operations: < 500ms
- Complex filtering: < 200ms

**Test Coverage**:

- Dashboard load performance
- Order list interactions
- Map rendering with multiple markers
- Bulk operations performance
- Real-time update responsiveness
- Large dataset filtering
- KPI accuracy and live data
- Admin shell responsiveness
- Concurrent operations handling

### 3. Admin Dashboard Security Tests (`admin-security.spec.ts`)

**Purpose**: Security validation and vulnerability prevention

**Security Checks**:

- ✅ **2FA for admin access**
- ✅ **Least-privilege role enforcement**
- ✅ **SSRF attack prevention**
- ✅ **CSRF protection**
- ✅ **Audit trail without secrets**
- ✅ **Session timeout enforcement**
- ✅ **IP allowlist for high-risk actions**
- ✅ **Unauthorized API access prevention**
- ✅ **Input sanitization**
- ✅ **Secure headers enforcement**
- ✅ **File upload validation**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tests failing due to missing test data**

```bash
# Ensure test data is seeded
npm run db:seed
```

**Performance tests timing out**

```bash
# Increase timeout in playwright.config.ts
timeout: 30000
```

**Security tests failing**

```bash
# Check environment variables
echo $STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
echo $PUSHER_KEY
```

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Run tests in debug mode
npm run test:admin-acceptance -- --debug
```

5. **Memory Usage**: Monitor for memory leaks

### Performance Alerts

Set up alerts for:

- Dashboard load time > 1.5 seconds
- API response time > 500ms
- Database query time > 100ms
- Real-time update latency > 200ms

## Security Monitoring
