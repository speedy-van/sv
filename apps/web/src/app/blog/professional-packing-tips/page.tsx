  {
    question: 'How far in advance should I start packing for a move?',
    answer: 'Ideally, start packing 4-6 weeks before your move date. Begin with items you rarely use, such as seasonal decorations, books, and off-season clothing. Pack one room at a time, leaving essential items for the final week. This gradual approach reduces stress and ensures nothing is forgotten.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What packing materials do I need for a house move?',
    answer: 'Essential packing materials include: sturdy cardboard boxes in various sizes, bubble wrap for fragile items, packing paper or newspaper, strong packing tape, markers for labeling, furniture blankets, and stretch wrap. For delicate items, consider specialty boxes like wardrobe boxes, dish packs, and mirror boxes.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I pack fragile items safely?',
    answer: 'Wrap each fragile item individually in bubble wrap or packing paper. Use crumpled paper to fill empty spaces in boxes to prevent movement. Place heavier items at the bottom and lighter, more delicate items on top. Label boxes clearly as "FRAGILE" and indicate which side should face up. Never overpack boxes with breakables.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I hire professional packers or do it myself?',
    answer: 'This depends on your budget, time, and the complexity of your move. Professional packers are ideal if you have valuable items, limited time, or a large household. DIY packing saves money but requires significant time and effort. Many people choose a hybrid approach: packing most items themselves while hiring professionals for fragile or valuable items.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How can I reduce packing time and stress?',
    answer: 'Create a detailed packing plan and timeline. Declutter before packing to reduce the volume of items. Pack one room at a time and label boxes clearly with contents and destination room. Keep essential items separate in a clearly marked box. Use color-coded labels or a numbering system to track boxes. Consider hiring professional packers for the most time-consuming rooms.',

              <ListItem><strong>Small boxes (1.5 cubic feet):</strong> Perfect for heavy items like books, tools, and canned goods. These prevent overloading and make boxes easier to carry.</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>Medium boxes (3 cubic feet):</strong> Ideal for kitchen items, toys, electronics, and small appliances. The most versatile box size for general household items.</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>Large boxes (4.5 cubic feet):</strong> Best for lightweight, bulky items such as bedding, pillows, lampshades, and soft toys. Never use these for heavy items.</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>Wardrobe boxes:</strong> Specialty boxes with hanging bars that allow you to transfer clothes directly from your closet without folding, saving significant time.</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>Dish pack boxes:</strong> Extra-thick cardboard boxes with dividers designed specifically for plates, glasses, and other fragile kitchenware.</ListItem>

              <ListItem><strong>Furniture blankets:</strong> Thick, padded blankets that protect furniture surfaces from scratches, dents, and damage during transport.</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>Stretch wrap:</strong> Plastic film that keeps drawers closed, protects upholstered furniture, and bundles items together without leaving adhesive residue.</ListItem>

              Kitchen Packing Tips
            </Heading>
            <Text fontSize="lg" lineHeight="tall" mb={3}>
              The kitchen is often the most challenging room to pack due to numerous fragile items and awkward shapes. Start packing your kitchen at least two weeks before your move, keeping only essential items for daily use.
            </Text>
            <UnorderedList spacing={2} mb={4} fontSize="lg">
              <ListItem><strong>Dishes and plates:</strong> Wrap each plate individually in packing paper or foam pouches. Stack vertically (on edge) rather than flat—this distributes weight better and reduces breakage risk by up to 80%.</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>Glasses and mugs:</strong> Wrap each glass in bubble wrap, paying extra attention to stems on wine glasses. Fill the inside with crumpled paper for added protection. Pack in dish pack boxes with dividers.</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>Pots and pans:</strong> Stack pots with paper between each one. Place lids separately wrapped in paper. Use pots as packing containers for smaller kitchen items to save space.</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>Small appliances:</strong> If possible, pack in original boxes. Otherwise, wrap in bubble wrap and pack in medium boxes. Keep cords wrapped and taped to the appliance.</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>Pantry items:</strong> Check expiration dates and dispose of old items. Place liquids in sealed plastic bags to prevent spills. Pack heavy canned goods in small boxes to keep weight manageable.</ListItem>

              Bedrooms typically contain a mix of clothing, personal items, and sometimes valuable possessions. Organization is key to efficient bedroom packing.
            </Text>
            <UnorderedList spacing={2} mb={4} fontSize="lg">
              <ListItem><strong>Clothing:</strong> Use wardrobe boxes for hanging clothes to save time folding and unpacking. Fold and pack casual clothes in medium boxes or suitcases. Vacuum-seal bags work well for bulky items like winter coats and comforters.</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>Shoes:</strong> Keep pairs together with rubber bands or in individual bags. Pack in original shoe boxes when possible, or use small to medium boxes. Stuff shoes with paper to maintain shape.</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>Jewelry and valuables:</strong> Pack these separately in a small box you'll transport personally. Never leave valuables in the moving van unattended.</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>Bedding:</strong> Use large boxes or vacuum-seal bags for comforters, pillows, and blankets. These items can also serve as padding for fragile items when packed carefully.</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>Dresser drawers:</strong> You can often leave lightweight items like clothing in drawers. Use stretch wrap to secure drawers closed. Remove heavy items and fragile objects.</ListItem>

            <UnorderedList spacing={2} mb={4} fontSize="lg">
              <ListItem><strong>Electronics:</strong> Take photos of cable connections before disconnecting. Pack TVs and monitors in original boxes if available, or use specialty TV boxes. Wrap in bubble wrap and mark "FRAGILE" and "THIS SIDE UP" clearly.</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>Books:</strong> Pack books spine-down in small boxes to prevent damage. Don't overfill boxes—books are heavy. Alternate between laying books flat and standing them upright to distribute weight.</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>Picture frames and artwork:</strong> Wrap in bubble wrap and use corner protectors. Pack vertically in boxes with cardboard between each piece. Label "FRAGILE" and indicate which side should face up.</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>Decorative items:</strong> Wrap each item individually in bubble wrap or packing paper. Fill empty spaces in boxes with crumpled paper to prevent shifting during transport.</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>Lamps:</strong> Remove bulbs and lampshades. Wrap bases in bubble wrap and pack in medium boxes. Pack shades separately in large boxes with plenty of padding.</ListItem>

              <ListItem><strong>Towels and linens:</strong> These make excellent packing materials for fragile items. Use them to wrap dishes, glasses, or fill gaps in boxes.</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>Cleaning supplies:</strong> Dispose of hazardous materials properly—many moving companies won't transport them. Pack remaining supplies in sealed plastic bags inside boxes.</ListItem>

              The Weight Distribution Method
            </Heading>
            <Text fontSize="lg" lineHeight="tall" mb={3}>
              Professional movers always pack boxes with heavier items at the bottom and lighter items on top. This prevents crushing and makes boxes more stable during transport. Each box should weigh no more than 50 pounds (about 23 kg) to ensure safe lifting and prevent injuries.

              The Color-Coding System
            </Heading>
            <Text fontSize="lg" lineHeight="tall" mb={3}>
              Assign a color to each room in your new home. Use colored markers, stickers, or tape to label boxes accordingly. This visual system makes it immediately clear where each box should go, saving hours during the unpacking process. Create a master list that shows which color corresponds to which room.

              The Essential Box Strategy
            </Heading>
            <Text fontSize="lg" lineHeight="tall" mb={3}>
              Pack a clearly labeled "OPEN FIRST" box for each family member containing essentials for the first 24-48 hours: toiletries, medications, phone chargers, a change of clothes, important documents, and basic kitchen supplies. This prevents frantic searching through boxes when you arrive at your new home exhausted from moving day.

            <Text fontSize="lg" lineHeight="tall" mb={4}>
              Number each box and maintain a detailed inventory list. This can be as simple as a numbered list on paper or as sophisticated as a spreadsheet or moving app. Include the box number, room destination, and brief contents description. This system helps you track everything and quickly locate specific items after the move.

              Even experienced movers sometimes make these common packing errors. Avoid these pitfalls to ensure a smoother moving experience:
            </Text>
            <UnorderedList spacing={3} fontSize="lg">
              <ListItem><strong>Starting too late:</strong> Packing always takes longer than expected. Begin at least 4-6 weeks before your move date to avoid last-minute stress.</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>Using damaged boxes:</strong> Weak or damaged boxes can collapse during transport, potentially damaging contents. Always use sturdy, new or like-new boxes.</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>Overpacking boxes:</strong> Heavy boxes are difficult to carry and more likely to break. Keep boxes under 50 pounds and fill large boxes with lightweight items only.</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>Under-protecting fragile items:</strong> When it comes to bubble wrap and packing paper, more is better. Don't skimp on protective materials for valuable or sentimental items.</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>Forgetting to label boxes:</strong> Unlabeled boxes create chaos during unpacking. Label every box with its contents and destination room on multiple sides.</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>Packing prohibited items:</strong> Moving companies cannot transport hazardous materials, perishables, or certain valuables. Check with your mover about restrictions.</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>Not decluttering first:</strong> Moving is the perfect opportunity to purge unwanted items. Donate, sell, or discard items you no longer need before packing.</ListItem>
