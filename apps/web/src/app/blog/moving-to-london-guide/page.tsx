  {
    question: 'What is the average cost of moving to London?',
    answer: 'The cost varies significantly based on where you\'re moving from and the volume of belongings. Local moves within London typically cost £300-£800 for a 2-bedroom flat. Long-distance moves from other UK cities range from £800-£2,500. Additional costs include deposits (typically 5 weeks\' rent), letting agent fees, and initial setup expenses for utilities and council tax.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which London neighborhoods are best for families?',
    answer: 'Richmond, Wimbledon, and Dulwich are excellent for families, offering good schools, green spaces, and community atmosphere. Greenwich and Blackheath provide a village feel with excellent transport links. For more affordable options, consider Ealing, Walthamstow, or Bromley, which offer good schools and family-friendly amenities at lower prices.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does London\'s transport system work?',
    answer: 'London\'s transport network includes the Underground (Tube), buses, Overground, DLR, and National Rail services. Get an Oyster card or use contactless payment for the best fares. The network is divided into zones 1-9, with zones 1-2 covering central London. Daily and weekly caps limit your spending. Consider your commute when choosing where to live, as transport costs add up quickly.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need a car in London?',
    answer: 'Most Londoners don\'t own cars due to excellent public transport, high parking costs, and the Congestion Charge (£15/day for driving in central London). However, outer London areas may benefit from car ownership. Consider your specific circumstances: families with young children, jobs requiring travel outside London, or living in poorly connected areas might find a car useful.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I find accommodation in London?',
    answer: 'Start your search on platforms like Rightmove, Zoopla, and SpareRoom. Be prepared to move quickly—good properties rent fast. Budget for 5 weeks\' rent as deposit plus first month\'s rent upfront. Consider temporary accommodation initially while you search in person. Be aware of scams: never transfer money before viewing a property and verifying the landlord\'s identity.',

              Understanding London's Geography and Zones
            </Heading>
            <Text fontSize="lg" lineHeight="tall" mb={4}>
              London is divided into several distinct areas, each with its own character, advantages, and price points. Understanding this geography is crucial for choosing where to live and work.
            </Text>

            <Heading as="h3" size="lg" mb={3}>
              Central London (Zones 1-2)
            </Heading>
            <Text fontSize="lg" lineHeight="tall" mb={4}>
              Central London encompasses the City of London, Westminster, and surrounding areas. This is where you'll find major tourist attractions, business districts, and the highest property prices. Areas like Shoreditch, Camden, and Clapham offer vibrant nightlife and cultural scenes. Living centrally means shorter commutes but significantly higher costs—expect to pay £2,000-£3,500+ per month for a one-bedroom flat.
            </Text>

            <Heading as="h3" size="lg" mb={3}>
              Inner London (Zones 2-4)
            </Heading>
            <Text fontSize="lg" lineHeight="tall" mb={4}>
              Inner London provides a balance between accessibility and affordability. Areas like Brixton, Hackney, Walthamstow, and Stratford offer excellent transport links, diverse communities, and more reasonable rents (£1,400-£2,200 for a one-bedroom). These neighborhoods have seen significant regeneration and offer great amenities, parks, and local culture.

            <Heading as="h3" size="lg" mb={3}>
              Outer London (Zones 4-6)
            </Heading>
            <Text fontSize="lg" lineHeight="tall" mb={4}>
              Outer London areas like Croydon, Bromley, Ealing, and Harrow offer more space for your money, better access to green spaces, and a more suburban lifestyle. One-bedroom flats typically cost £1,000-£1,600 per month. While commutes are longer (45-60 minutes to central London), these areas are ideal for families and those prioritizing space over proximity to the city center.

            </Heading>
            <Text fontSize="lg" lineHeight="tall" mb={4}>
              London's public transport network is one of the world's most comprehensive, but it can be overwhelming for newcomers. Here's everything you need to know to navigate the city efficiently.

              The Underground (Tube)
            </Heading>
            <Text fontSize="lg" lineHeight="tall" mb={4}>
              The Tube is the fastest way to travel across London, with 11 lines serving 272 stations. Service runs from approximately 5:00 AM to midnight on weekdays, with Night Tube services on weekends on major lines (Central, Jubilee, Northern, Piccadilly, and Victoria). Peak hours (7:30-9:30 AM and 5:00-7:00 PM) are extremely crowded—avoid if possible or consider flexible working hours.

              Buses
            </Heading>
            <Text fontSize="lg" lineHeight="tall" mb={4}>
              London's extensive bus network covers areas the Tube doesn't reach. Buses run 24 hours on many routes, with night buses (prefixed with 'N') serving most areas after midnight. Bus fares are cheaper than the Tube (£1.75 per journey with Hopper fare allowing unlimited bus and tram journeys within one hour). Upper deck offers better views and is less crowded.

            <Text fontSize="lg" lineHeight="tall" mb={4}>
              The Overground connects outer London areas and is less crowded than the Tube. The Docklands Light Railway (DLR) serves East London and Docklands with driverless trains. The new Elizabeth Line (opened 2022) provides fast connections from Reading and Heathrow in the west to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east, significantly reducing journey times across London.

              <ListItem><strong>Application:</strong> If interested, submit your application immediately with references, proof of income (usually 30x monthly rent as annual salary), and ID.</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>Referencing:</strong> Landlords will check your credit history, employment, and previous landlord references. This takes 3-7 days.</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>Deposit:</strong> Typically 5 weeks' rent, protected in a government-approved scheme (DPS, TDS, or MyDeposits).</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>First Month's Rent:</strong> Paid upfront before moving in.</ListItem>
              <ListItem><strong>Contract Signing:</strong> Review the tenancy agreement carefully. Standard is an Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST) for 6-12 months.</ListItem>
