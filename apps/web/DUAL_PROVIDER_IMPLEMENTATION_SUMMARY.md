## 🚀 Setup Requirements

### Environment Variables
Add to your `.env.local` file:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_places_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=pk.eyJ1IjoiYWhtYWRhbHdha2FpIiwiYSI6ImNtZGNsZ3RsZDEzdGsya3F0ODFxeGRzbXoifQ.jfgGW0KNFTwATOShRDtQsg
```

### Google Cloud Setup
1. Create Google Cloud project
2. Enable Places API, Distance Matrix API, Maps JavaScript API
3. Create API key with proper restrictions
4. Configure billing (required for API usage)

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Basic Address Input
```tsx
import { DualProviderAddressInput } from '@/components/address/DualProviderAddressInput';

<DualProviderAddressInput
  id="pickup-address"
  label="Pickup Address"
  placeholder="Enter your address"
  onChange={(suggestion) => {
    if (suggestion) {
      console.log('Selected:', suggestion);
    }
  }}
  onValidation={(isValid) => {
    console.log('Valid:', isValid);
  }}
/>
```

### Confused.com Pattern
```tsx
import { ConfusedComPattern } from '@/components/address/ConfusedComPattern';

<ConfusedComPattern
  step="postcode"
  onStepComplete={(step, data) => {
    console.log('Step completed:', step, data);
  }}
  onStepChange={(step) => {
    console.log('Step changed:', step);
  }}
/>
```

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Caching Strategy
- Postcode validation: 7 days TTL
- Address suggestions: 24h (Google), 12h (Mapbox)
- Distance calculations: 1 hour TTL
- Cross-provider validation for accuracy

- Cost tracking

### Debug Mode
Set `NODE_ENV=development` for:
- Provider switching notifications
- Performance metrics
- Cache information
- Error details

## 🔄 Migration Notes

The new system is backward compatible with existing booking flows. Simply replace:

```tsx
// Old
import AddressAutocompleteInput from '@/components/ui/AddressAutocompleteInput';

// New  
import { DualProviderAddressInput } from '@/components/address/DualProviderAddressInput';
```

Component props and behavior remain the same with enhanced reliability.
