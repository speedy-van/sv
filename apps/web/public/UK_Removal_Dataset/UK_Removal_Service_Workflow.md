## Luton Van Capacity and Worker Allocation

A standard Luton van has a capacity of approximately 14-15 cubic meters. The 'Van Units' in the tables above provide a guideline for how many of each item can fit into a single van. This is an estimate and can be affected by the shape and size of other items in the load.

### Worker Allocation Logic

- **1 Worker:** Items that can be safely handled by one person. These are typically lighter than 25kg and have no awkward dimensions.
- **2 Workers:** Items that are heavy (over 25kg), bulky, or require careful handling due to fragility or size. Two workers are mandatory for items like large sofas, wardrobes, and major appliances.
- **3-4 Workers:** Reserved for exceptionally heavy or awkward items like hot tubs, pool tables, and grand pianos. These require specialist handling and equipment.



## Handling and Loading/Unloading Best Practices

### General Guidelines

- **Assess the item:** Before lifting, assess the item's weight, size, and shape. Check for any special handling instructions.
- **Clear the path:** Ensure the path from the item's location to the van is clear of obstacles.
- **Use correct lifting techniques:** Bend at the knees, not the waist, and keep your back straight. Lift with your legs, not your back.
- **Use equipment:** Use trolleys, dollies, and moving blankets to protect items and make them easier to move.
- **Communicate:** When working in a team, communicate clearly to coordinate movements.

### Loading the Van

1.  **Heavy Items First:** Load the heaviest items first, such as washing machines, fridges, and large sofas. Place them against the front wall of the van (the bulkhead) to ensure the weight is over the front axle.
2.  **Long Items Next:** Place long items like mattresses, headboards, and long mirrors along the sides of the van.
3.  **Medium-Weight Items:** Load medium-weight items like dining chairs, tables, and chests of drawers in the middle of the van.
4.  **Light and Fragile Items Last:** Load the lightest and most fragile items last, placing them on top of other items or in a secure space where they won't move during transit.
5.  **Fill the Gaps:** Use soft items like bags of clothes or bedding to fill any gaps and prevent items from shifting.
6.  **Secure the Load:** Use straps to secure the load and prevent it from moving. Tie off sections as you go.

### Unloading the Van

Unload the van in the reverse order of loading:

1.  **Light and Fragile Items First:** Unload the most fragile items first and place them in a safe location in the new property.
2.  **Medium-Weight Items:** Unload the medium-weight items next.
3.  **Heavy Items Last:** Unload the heaviest items last.

### Item-Specific Handling

- **Furniture:** Disassemble furniture where possible (e.g., remove legs from tables, dismantle bed frames). Wrap furniture in moving blankets to protect it from scratches and dents.
- **Appliances:** Ensure appliances are empty, clean, and dry before moving. Secure drums in washing machines, and disconnect and drain any water from dishwashers or fridges.
- **Fragile Items:** Pack fragile items like glassware, mirrors, and pictures in appropriate boxes with plenty of padding. Mark the boxes as "FRAGILE" and handle them with care.
- **Electronics:** Use original packaging for electronics where possible. If not available, use sturdy boxes with plenty of padding. Take photos of cable connections before disconnecting them to make reassembly easier.
- **Pianos and Specialist Items:** These items require specialist equipment and handling techniques. Always refer to a senior team member or a specialist for guidance.
