## Item Specifications

Each item in the database includes:

- **Dimensions:** Length, width, height (cm)
- **Area:** Floor area in square meters (m²)
- **Weight:** Item weight in kilograms (kg)
- **Van Units:** Number of items that fit in a standard Luton van (14-15 m³)
- **Workers:** Number of workers required (1, 2, 3, or 4)
- **Loading Complexity:** Easy, Medium, or Difficult
- **Special Handling:** Specific handling requirements and precautions
- **Image Filename:** Corresponding image file reference

## Van Capacity Guidelines

**Standard Luton Van Capacity:** 14-15 cubic meters

The "Van Units" field indicates how many of each item can typically fit in a single van. This is an estimate that can be affected by the shape and size of other items in the load.

## Worker Allocation Logic

- **1 Worker:** Items under 25kg with no awkward dimensions (bedside tables, small chairs, boxes, soft bags)
- **2 Workers:** Items over 25kg, bulky items, or fragile items requiring careful handling (wardrobes, king/super-king beds, 3-seater+ sofas, American fridges, washing machines, pianos)
- **3-4 Workers:** Exceptionally heavy or awkward items requiring specialist handling (hot tubs, pool tables, grand pianos)

## Loading Best Practices

### Loading Order:
1. **Heavy Items First:** Washing machines, fridges, large sofas (against front wall/bulkhead)
2. **Medium Items:** Tables, chairs, dining sets (middle of van)
3. **Light/Fragile Items:** Lamps, mirrors, boxed items (loaded last, secured on top)

### General Guidelines:
- Use correct lifting techniques (bend knees, straight back)
- Use equipment: trolleys, dollies, moving blankets
- Clear paths before moving items
- Communicate clearly when working in teams
- Secure loads with straps and corner protectors
