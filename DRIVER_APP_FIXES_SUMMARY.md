### 2. Missing Screens (ESSENTIAL)
Created all missing screens with professional UI/UX:

**Authentication Screens:**
- âœ… `forgot-password.tsx` - Email input with validation
- âœ… `reset-password.tsx` - Password reset with requirements

**Job Management:**
- âœ… `job/[id].tsx` - Full job details with:
  - Interactive map (pickup/dropoff markers + route)
  - Customer information
  - Call & navigate buttons
  - Accept/Decline/Start/Complete actions

**Optional Enhancements:**
- âœ… `settings.tsx` - Profile editing, vehicle info, privacy settings
