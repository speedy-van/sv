## Overview

The Speedy Van system is designed to intelligently handle large orders that exceed the capacity of a single Luton van. This document outlines how the system automatically splits large orders across multiple vehicles while maintaining operational efficiency and fair driver compensation.

## Large Order Processing Workflow

### 1. Order Analysis and Splitting

When a large order is received (e.g., full house move, office relocation), the system performs the following analysis:

#### Capacity Assessment
1. **Volume Calculation**: The system calculates the total cubic meter volume of all items in the order
2. **Van Requirement Determination**: 
   - Single Luton van capacity = 15m³ maximum
   - If order volume = 42m³, system determines 3 vans required
3. **Intelligent Item Distribution**: Items are logically grouped by room or category
4. **Route Generation**: Each van receives an independent, optimized route

#### Example: £4,000 Order Requiring 3 Vans
```
Customer Order: 4-bedroom house move
Total Volume: 42 cubic meters
Vans Required: 3 vans
Customer Payment: £4,000
```

### 2. Smart Order Division Strategy

The system employs intelligent algorithms to distribute items across multiple vans:

#### Van 1 (15m³ - 100% capacity):
- Master bedroom furniture
- Large wardrobe
- King-size bed
- **Distance**: 25 miles
- **Drops**: 1 location

#### Van 2 (15m³ - 100% capacity):
- Children's bedroom furniture
- Partial living room items
- **Distance**: 25 miles
- **Drops**: 1 location

#### Van 3 (12m³ - 80% capacity):
- Kitchen appliances
- Remaining living room furniture
- **Distance**: 25 miles
- **Drops**: 1 location

### 3. Driver Earnings Calculation for Multi-Van Orders

Each driver is compensated independently based on their specific van's load and route:

#### Driver 1 (Van 1) Earnings:
```
Base Distance Rate: 25 × £1.50 = £37.50
Multi-Drop Bonus: £0 (single drop)
Capacity Bonus: £37.50 × 0.10 = £3.75 (100% utilization)
Time-Based Pay: £15 (loading/unloading)
Gross Earnings: £56.25
Platform Fee (20%): £11.25
Net Earnings: £45.00
```

#### Driver 2 (Van 2) Earnings:
```
Base Distance Rate: 25 × £1.50 = £37.50
Multi-Drop Bonus: £0 (single drop)
Capacity Bonus: £37.50 × 0.10 = £3.75 (100% utilization)
Time-Based Pay: £15 (loading/unloading)
Gross Earnings: £56.25
Platform Fee (20%): £11.25
Net Earnings: £45.00
```

#### Driver 3 (Van 3) Earnings:
```
Base Distance Rate: 25 × £1.50 = £37.50
Multi-Drop Bonus: £0 (single drop)
Capacity Bonus: £37.50 × 0.05 = £1.88 (80% utilization)
Time-Based Pay: £15 (loading/unloading)
Gross Earnings: £54.38
Platform Fee (20%): £10.88
Net Earnings: £43.50
```

### 4. Financial Breakdown Summary

#### Total Driver Compensation:
- Driver 1: £45.00
- Driver 2: £45.00
- Driver 3: £43.50
- **Total Driver Payments**: £133.50 (3.3% of customer payment)

#### Revenue Distribution from £4,000 Order:
- Driver Earnings: £133.50 (3.3%)
- Platform Fees: £33.13 (0.8%)
- **Company Profit**: £3,833.37 (95.9%)

### 6. Alternative Scenarios

#### Scenario A: Multi-Location Pickup Order
```
Customer Payment: £4,000
Requirement: Collect from 3 different locations, deliver to 1 location
Vans Required: 2 vans
```

**Driver 1** (2 pickup locations):
- Multi-Drop Bonus: +£15 (2 drops)
- **Net Earnings**: £65.00

**Driver 2** (1 pickup location):
- Multi-Drop Bonus: £0
- **Net Earnings**: £45.00

#### Scenario B: Long-Distance Large Order
```
Customer Payment: £4,000
Distance: 200 miles per van
Vans Required: 2 vans
```

**Each Driver Earnings**:
- Base Distance Rate: (30×£1.50) + (100×£1.20) + (70×£1.00) = £235.00
- Capacity Bonus: £23.50
- **Net Earnings**: £206.80 per driver
