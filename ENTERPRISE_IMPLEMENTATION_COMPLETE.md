- User ‚Üí PerformanceMetrics (1:many)

## üñ•Ô∏è USER INTERFACES

### Enterprise Admin Dashboard
- **Location:** `src/components/admin/EnterpriseAdminDashboard.tsx`
- **Features:**
  - Real-time operational metrics
  - Live route monitoring
  - Driver performance tracking
  - Revenue analytics with growth trends
  - Route optimization controls

### API Endpoints
- `/api/analytics/operational` - Operational KPIs
- `/api/analytics/revenue` - Revenue breakdown
- `/api/analytics/drivers` - Driver performance data
- `/api/analytics/customers` - Customer analytics
- `/api/analytics/report` - Comprehensive reports

## üîß CORE ALGORITHMS

### 1. Dynamic Pricing Formula
```
Base Price = (Distance √ó Rate) + Fixed Fee
Market Multiplier = Supply/Demand Ratio
Service Multiplier = Tier Factor (1.0-2.5x)
Urgency Multiplier = Time-based Factor
Weather Multiplier = Condition Impact
Final Price = Base √ó Market √ó Service √ó Urgency √ó Weather
```

### 2. Performance Score Calculation
```
Performance Score = (CSAT√ó0.4) + (OTP√ó0.3) + (FTSR√ó0.2) + (ARC√ó0.1)
- CSAT: Customer Satisfaction (1-5)
- OTP: On-Time Performance (0-1)
- FTSR: First-Time Success Rate (0-1) 
- ARC: Accurate Route Completion (0-1)
```

### 3. Payout Calculation
```
Base Driver Share = 70%
Performance Bonus = (Score - 80) √ó 1% (max 20%)
Final Share = Base + Performance Bonus
Driver Payout = Route Revenue √ó Final Share
```
