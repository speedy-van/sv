## Current Profile Analysis

### Existing Profiles

You currently have **two separate Google Business Profile locations**:

1. **Speedy Van – Glasgow**
   - Address: 140 Charles Street, Glasgow G21 2QB
   - Status: Active
   - Coverage: Local Glasgow area only

2. **Speedy van – Dundee/London**
   - Address: 14a London, UK, Dundee, UK
   - Status: Active
   - Coverage: Multiple areas (Dundee, London, and 14 other regions)

### Critical Issues Identified

The current setup has several problems that limit your visibility and increase advertising costs:

**Geographic Fragmentation:** Having two separate profiles splits your reviews, engagement metrics, and search authority across multiple locations instead of building a single strong nationwide presence.

**Inconsistent Branding:** The profiles use different naming conventions ("Speedy Van" vs "Speedy van") which weakens brand recognition and confuses potential customers.

**Limited Coverage:** The Glasgow profile only appears in local Glasgow searches, missing opportunities in other major UK cities where you provide services.

**Inefficient Ad Spend:** Without proper service area configuration, your Google Ads campaigns are likely showing to irrelevant audiences or missing key markets entirely.

---

## Optimization Strategy Overview

### Strategic Approach

The optimization strategy follows a proven methodology used by successful national service companies like **Fantastic Services**, **AnyVan**, and **Shiply** to dominate UK-wide search results.

**Phase 1: Profile Consolidation** involves selecting one primary profile and converting it to a service-area business model. This consolidates all your authority, reviews, and engagement metrics into a single powerful profile.

**Phase 2: Nationwide Coverage** expands your service areas to cover all major UK cities and regions, ensuring your business appears in local search results across England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

**Phase 3: Content Optimization** updates all profile information with SEO-optimized descriptions, professional imagery, and comprehensive service listings that target high-value keywords.

**Phase 4: Engagement Maximization** activates all Google Business features including Q&A, posts, messaging, and review management to boost your profile's ranking signals.

**Phase 5: Technical Integration** connects your profile with your website through Schema markup and creates dedicated landing pages for each service area to strengthen local SEO signals.

---

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Phase 1: Profile Setup and Consolidation

#### Step 1.1: Choose Your Primary Profile

**Recommended Action:** Use the **Dundee/London profile** as your primary profile since it already has service-area coverage configured.

**Rationale:** This profile is already set up as a service-area business covering multiple regions. We will expand and optimize this existing configuration rather than converting the Glasgow profile from scratch.

#### Step 1.2: Access Your Google Business Profile

1. Navigate to [business.google.com](https://business.google.com)
2. Sign in with your Google account (already completed)
3. Select the **Speedy van – Dundee/London** profile
4. Click **"Edit Profile"** to begin modifications

#### Step 1.3: Update Business Name

**Current Name:** Speedy van  
**Updated Name:** Speedy Van

**Instructions:**
1. Click on the business name field
2. Change to **"Speedy Van"** (capitalize the "V")
3. Ensure consistency with your official branding
4. Click **"Save"**

**Important:** Google may require verification if you change the business name. Be prepared to verify via phone, email, or postcard.

#### Step 1.4: Update Business Address

**Current Address:** 14a London, UK, Dundee, UK (incorrect format)  
**Correct Address:** Office 2.18, 1 Barrack Street, Hamilton, ML3 0DG

**Instructions:**
1. Click **"Edit Profile"** → **"Contact"** tab
2. Update the address fields:
   - **Address Line 1:** 1 Barrack Street
   - **Address Line 2:** Office 2.18
   - **Town/City:** Hamilton
   - **Postcode:** ML3 0DG
   - **Country:** United Kingdom
3. In the **"Located within"** field, enter: **Barracks Business Centre**
4. Click **"Save"**

**Note:** Since you are a service-area business, you can choose to hide your physical address from customers. However, Google still requires a valid registered address for verification purposes.

#### Step 1.5: Hide Physical Address (Recommended)

**Instructions:**
1. In the **"Contact"** section, find the option **"I deliver goods and services to my customers"**
2. Check this box
3. Select **"Hide my address"** (customers will only see your service areas, not your office address)
4. Click **"Save"**

**Rationale:** Service-area businesses like moving companies typically hide their physical address because customers don't visit the office location. This also prevents competitors from easily identifying your operational base.

---

### Phase 2: Service Area Configuration

#### Step 2.1: Remove Incorrect Service Areas

**Instructions:**
1. Navigate to **"Edit Profile"** → **"Service Areas"**
2. Review the current list of service areas
3. Remove any incorrectly formatted or duplicate entries (e.g., "14a London, UK")
4. Click **"Save"**

#### Step 2.2: Add Comprehensive UK Coverage

**Instructions:**
1. Click **"Add service area"**
2. Add the following areas one by one:

**National Coverage:**
- United Kingdom
- England
- Scotland
- Wales

**Major Cities (Northern Ireland):**

3. After adding all areas, click **"Save"**

3. Validate the schema using [Google's Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)
4. Submit your sitemap to Google Search Console

**Rationale:** Schema markup helps Google understand your business information and can result in rich snippets (star ratings, pricing, service areas) appearing directly in search results, significantly increasing click-through rates.
