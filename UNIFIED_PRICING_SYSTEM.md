# Unified Pricing System - Single Order & Multi-Drop Routes

**Date:** 12 October 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

---

## Overview

The Dynamic Pricing Engine now handles **both** booking types with a unified, intelligent pricing system:

1. **Single Order:** Direct delivery from A to B (e.g., Glasgow → London)
2. **Multi-Drop Route:** Customer's order is part of a shared route with other customers

---

## Key Improvements

### 1. Real Distance Calculation ✅

**Before:**
```typescript
// ❌ HARDCODED
return 15; // miles
```

**After:**
```typescript
// ✅ HAVERSINE FORMULA
const R = 3958.8; // Earth's radius in miles
// ... accurate calculation
const roadDistance = distance * 1.15; // Add 15% for actual roads
return Math.round(roadDistance);
```

**Impact:**
- Glasgow → London: Now correctly calculated as **~400 miles** (not 15!)
- Accurate pricing for all distances

---

### 2. Tiered Distance Pricing ✅

**Pricing Tiers:**

| Distance Range | Rate per Mile | Example |
|----------------|---------------|---------|
| 0-5 miles | **FREE** | Included in base price |
| 6-50 miles | **£2.50/mile** | 20 miles = £37.50 |
| 51-150 miles | **£2.00/mile** | 100 miles = £212.50 |
| 151-300 miles | **£1.50/mile** | 200 miles = £387.50 |
| 300+ miles | **£1.20/mile** | 400 miles = £657.50 |

**Why Tiered?**
- Short distances: Higher rate (more overhead)
- Long distances: Lower rate (economies of scale)
- Competitive with market rates
- Encourages long-distance bookings

---

### 3. Multi-Drop Route Support ✅

**New Request Fields:**
```typescript
{
  isMultiDrop: true,
  multiDropInfo: {
    totalRouteDistance: 120, // Total route: 120 miles
    numberOfStops: 5, // 5 customers sharing the route
    customerSharePercentage: 0.25, // This customer's share: 25%
    estimatedTotalRouteCost: 500 // Total route cost: £500
  }
}
```

**Pricing Logic:**
1. Calculate total route cost using tiered pricing
2. Each customer pays their fair share
3. Base fare is reduced (since it's shared)
4. Items cost remains individual

## How Multi-Drop Share is Calculated

### Method 1: Equal Split (Simple)
```typescript
customerSharePercentage = 1 / numberOfStops
// 5 stops = 20% each
```

### Method 2: Distance-Based (Fair)
```typescript
customerSharePercentage = customerDistance / totalRouteDistance
// Customer travels 50 miles of 250-mile route = 20%
```

### Method 3: Weighted (Most Accurate)
```typescript
// Consider:
// - Distance traveled
// - Number of items
// - Loading/unloading time
// - Priority level

customerSharePercentage = (
  (customerDistance / totalDistance) * 0.6 +
  (customerItems / totalItems) * 0.3 +
  (customerTime / totalTime) * 0.1
)
```

**Recommendation:** Use Method 2 (Distance-Based) for transparency and fairness.
