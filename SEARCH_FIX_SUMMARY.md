# 🔍 Search Items Fix

## ❌ Problem
Search items was not working because `individualItems` state was empty during initial render.

## ✅ Solution
Initialize `individualItems` directly with `COMPREHENSIVE_CATALOG` instead of waiting for async load.

### Before:
```typescript
const [individualItems, setanys] = useState<any[]>([]);  // ❌ Empty!
const [individualItemsLoading, setanysLoading] = useState<boolean>(true);  // ❌ Loading = true
```

**Result:**
- Search had 0 items to search through
- Customers couldn't find anything
- Had to wait for async load

### After:
```typescript
const [individualItems, setanys] = useState<any[]>(COMPREHENSIVE_CATALOG);  // ✅ Pre-loaded!
const [individualItemsLoading, setanysLoading] = useState<boolean>(false);  // ✅ No loading
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Search works immediately
- ✅ All catalog items available
- ✅ No wait time
- ✅ Better UX

## 📊 Impact

- COMPREHENSIVE_CATALOG has 100+ curated items
- All available instantly
- Search/filter works immediately
- No async loading delays

**Status:** ✅ FIXED
