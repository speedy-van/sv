## Deployment Phases

### Phase 1: Shadow Mode (Week 1)

**Goal**: Deploy system without affecting live pricing

**Actions**:

1. Deploy all new components and APIs
2. Enable feature flags for shadow mode
3. Log pricing calculations without applying them
4. Monitor system performance and error rates

**Feature Flags**:

```typescript
// Environment variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRICING_SHADOW_MODE = true;
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRICING_NORMALIZATION_ENABLED = false;
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRICING_VOLUME_FACTOR_ENABLED = false;
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRICING_AUTOCOMPLETE_ENABLED = false;
```

**Monitoring**:

- Compare old vs new pricing calculations
- Track API response times
- Monitor error rates
- Log pricing discrepancies

### Phase 2: Gradual Rollout (Week 2)

**Goal**: Enable new features for a subset of users

**Actions**:

1. Enable normalization for 10% of users
2. Enable autocomplete for 10% of users
3. Monitor user feedback and system stability
4. Gradually increase user percentage

**Feature Flags**:

```typescript
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRICING_SHADOW_MODE = false;
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRICING_NORMALIZATION_ENABLED = true;
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRICING_VOLUME_FACTOR_ENABLED = true;
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRICING_AUTOCOMPLETE_ENABLED = true;
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRICING_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE = 10;
```

**User Selection**:

- Use user ID hash for consistent rollout
- Include beta testers and internal users
- Monitor conversion rates and user satisfaction

### Phase 3: Full Rollout (Week 3)

**Goal**: Enable new system for all users

**Actions**:

1. Enable all features for 100% of users
2. Monitor system performance under full load
3. Collect user feedback and metrics
4. Prepare rollback plan if issues arise

**Feature Flags**:

```typescript
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRICING_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE = 100;
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRICING_FULL_ROLLOUT = true;
```

## Rollback Strategy

### Immediate Rollback (0-5 minutes)

**Trigger Conditions**:

- Critical pricing errors (>5% variance from expected)
- System crashes or unavailability
- Security vulnerabilities
- User complaints >10%

**Actions**:

1. Disable all new pricing features via feature flags
2. Revert to legacy pricing engine
3. Notify stakeholders
4. Begin investigation

**Feature Flags**:

```typescript
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRICING_EMERGENCY_ROLLBACK = true;
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRICING_USE_LEGACY_ENGINE = true;
```

### Gradual Rollback (5-30 minutes)

**Trigger Conditions**:

- Performance degradation (>2x response time)
- Pricing accuracy issues (2-5% variance)
- User experience problems

**Actions**:

1. Reduce rollout percentage to 50%
2. Enable shadow mode for affected users
3. Investigate root cause
4. Plan targeted fixes

### Full Rollback (30+ minutes)

**Trigger Conditions**:

- Persistent system issues
- Data integrity problems
- Business impact assessment

**Actions**:

1. Complete system rollback
2. Restore previous version
3. Post-mortem analysis
4. Plan re-deployment strategy

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Key Metrics

1. **Pricing Accuracy**
   - Variance between old and new pricing
   - User-reported pricing issues
   - Automated UAT test results

2. **System Performance**
   - API response times (target: <500ms)
   - Error rates (target: <1%)
   - System availability (target: 99.9%)

3. **User Experience**
   - Booking completion rates
   - User feedback scores
   - Support ticket volume

### Alerting Rules

```yaml
# Critical Alerts
- Pricing variance >10%: Immediate notification
- API errors >5%: Immediate notification
- System downtime: Immediate notification

# Warning Alerts
- Pricing variance 5-10%: 15-minute notification
- API response time >1s: 15-minute notification
- Error rate 1-5%: 15-minute notification

# Info Alerts
- New feature usage metrics: Daily report
- Performance trends: Weekly report
- User feedback summary: Weekly report
```

## Testing Strategy

### Pre-Deployment Testing

1. **Unit Tests**: All pricing engine functions
2. **Integration Tests**: API endpoints and data flow
3. **UAT Scenarios**: Validate pricing calculations
4. **Performance Tests**: Load testing under expected traffic
5. **Security Tests**: Input validation and sanitization

### Post-Deployment Testing

1. **Smoke Tests**: Basic functionality verification
2. **UAT Validation**: Run test scenarios against live system
3. **A/B Testing**: Compare old vs new pricing for sample users
4. **User Acceptance**: Monitor real user interactions
