**Purpose:** Allow drivers to preview their earnings **before** accepting a route.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "routeId": "RT1A2B3C4D",
  "earnings": {
    "total": 12500,
    "formatted": "£125.00",

    "numberOfStops": 5,
    "totalDistance": 45.2,
    "totalDuration": 180,
    "routeType": "multi-drop"
  },
  "metrics": {
    "earningsPerStop": 2500,
    "earningsPerMile": 276,
    "earningsPerHour": 4166,
    "formattedPerStop": "£25.00",
    "formattedPerMile": "£2.76",
    "formattedPerHour": "£41.66"

---

### 3. ✅ Route Creation Integration

**File:** `apps/web/src/app/api/admin/routes/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Calculate driver earnings when route is created
- ✅ Include earnings in Pusher notification
- ✅ Show earnings in notification message

**Before:**
```typescript
totalEarnings: 0, // Will be calculated by pricing engine
message: `New route ${routeNumber} assigned to you`
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Calculate driver earnings for the route
const { calculateRouteEarnings } = require('@/lib/services/driver-earnings-service');
const earningsResult = await calculateRouteEarnings(route.id);
totalEarnings = earningsResult.totalEarnings;

totalEarnings: totalEarnings, // ✅ Actual calculated earnings
formattedEarnings: `£${(totalEarnings / 100).toFixed(2)}`,
message: `New route ${routeNumber} assigned to you - Earn £${(totalEarnings / 100).toFixed(2)}`
```

**Result:** Driver sees earnings immediately when route is assigned.

---

### 4. ✅ Route Reassignment Integration

**File:** `apps/web/src/app/api/admin/routes/[id]/reassign/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Calculate earnings when route is reassigned
- ✅ Include earnings in route-matched event
- ✅ Show earnings in notification message

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Calculate driver earnings for the reassigned route
let totalEarnings = 0;
try {
  const { calculateRouteEarnings } = await import('@/lib/services/driver-earnings-service');
  const earningsResult = await calculateRouteEarnings(result.updatedRoute.id);
  totalEarnings = earningsResult.totalEarnings;
  console.log(`💰 Reassigned route earnings: £${(totalEarnings / 100).toFixed(2)}`);
} catch (earningsError) {
  console.error('⚠️ Failed to calculate route earnings:', earningsError);
  // Fallback to driverPayout if available
  totalEarnings = result.updatedRoute.driverPayout ? Number(result.updatedRoute.driverPayout) : 0;
}

await pusher.trigger(`driver-${newUserId}`, 'route-matched', {
  totalEarnings: totalEarnings, // ✅ Calculated driver earnings
  formattedEarnings: `£${(totalEarnings / 100).toFixed(2)}`,
  message: `Route ${displayReference} with ${result.bookingsCount} jobs has been reassigned to you - Earn £${(totalEarnings / 100).toFixed(2)}`
});
```

**Result:** Driver sees earnings when route is reassigned to them.

## 📊 Earnings Calculation Flow

### For Multi-Drop Routes

```

  - Mileage fee: £0.55 × 45 miles = £24.75
  - Time fee: £0.15 × 180 minutes = £27.00
  
  Subtotal: £136.75

Step 2: Apply multipliers
  - Urgency: 1.0x (standard)
  - Service type: 1.0x (standard)
  - Performance: 1.05x (on-time bonus)
  
  Subtotal: £143.59

Step 3: Add bonuses

  - On-time bonus: £5.00
  - High rating bonus: £8.00
  
  Total bonuses: £43.00

Step 4: Subtract penalties
  - None (on-time delivery)
  
  Total penalties: £0.00

Step 5: Add reimbursements
  - Tolls: £0.00
  - Parking: £0.00
  
  Total reimbursements: £0.00

Step 6: Calculate final earnings
  Gross earnings: £186.59
  Helper share (0%): £0.00
  Net earnings: £186.59
  
  Cap check: £186.59 < £500 (max) ✅
  Floor check: £186.59 > £20 (min) ✅
  
  Final earnings: £186.59
```

## 🎯 Driver Experience Improvements

### Before Upgrade
- ❌ Driver doesn't know earnings until after completion
- ❌ No earnings preview when route is assigned
- ❌ No way to check earnings before accepting
- ❌ Earnings calculation inconsistent

### After Upgrade
- ✅ Driver sees earnings in route assignment notification
- ✅ Driver can preview earnings via API call
- ✅ Earnings shown before accepting route
- ✅ Consistent calculation across all endpoints
- ✅ Detailed breakdown available
- ✅ Per-stop, per-mile, per-hour metrics shown

---

## 📱 iOS App Usage

### 1. Preview Earnings Before Accepting

```swift
func fetchRouteEarnings(routeId: String) async -> RouteEarnings? {
    guard let url = URL(string: "\(baseURL)/api/driver/routes/\(routeId)/earnings") else {
        return nil
    }
    
    let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
    let response = try JSONDecoder().decode(RouteEarningsResponse.self, from: data)
    
    return response.earnings
}
```

### 2. Display Earnings in Route Card

```swift
VStack(alignment: .leading) {
    Text("Route \(route.routeNumber)")
        .font(.headline)
    
    Text("\(route.numberOfStops) stops • \(route.totalDistance) miles")
        .font(.subheadline)
    
    HStack {
        Image(systemName: "dollarsign.circle.fill")
            .foregroundColor(.green)
        
        Text(route.formattedEarnings)
            .font(.title2)
            .fontWeight(.bold)
    }
    
    Text("£\(route.earningsPerStop) per stop")
        .font(.caption)
        .foregroundColor(.secondary)
}
```

### 3. Receive Earnings in Pusher Event

```swift
func handleRouteMatched(_ data: [String: Any]) {
    guard let routeId = data["routeId"] as? String,
          let totalEarnings = data["totalEarnings"] as? Int,
          let formattedEarnings = data["formattedEarnings"] as? String else {
        return
    }
    
    // Show notification with earnings
    NotificationService.shared.scheduleLocalNotification(
        title: "New Route Available",
        body: "Earn \(formattedEarnings) for \(jobCount) stops",
        userInfo: ["routeId": routeId, "earnings": totalEarnings]
    )
}
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Admin Dashboard Integration

The earnings service loads configuration from `PricingSettings` table:

```typescript
async loadConfigFromDatabase(): Promise<void> {
  const settings = await prisma.pricingSettings.findFirst({
    where: { isActive: true },
    orderBy: { updatedAt: 'desc' },
  });
  
  if (settings) {
    const multiplier = settings.driverRateMultiplier || 1.0;
    
    this.config.baseFarePerJob = Math.round(DEFAULT_CONFIG.baseFarePerJob * multiplier);
    this.config.perDropFee = Math.round(DEFAULT_CONFIG.perDropFee * multiplier);
    this.config.perMileFee = Math.round(DEFAULT_CONFIG.perMileFee * multiplier);
    this.config.perMinuteFee = Math.round(DEFAULT_CONFIG.perMinuteFee * multiplier);
  }
}
```

**Admin can adjust:**
- `driverRateMultiplier` - Global multiplier for all driver rates
- All rates update dynamically from database
