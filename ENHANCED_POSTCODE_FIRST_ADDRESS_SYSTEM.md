## 🚀 Integration Points

### Booking Form Integration
The component is used in:
- `apps/web/src/app/booking-luxury/components/WhereAndWhatStep.tsx`

**Usage Example:**
```tsx
<PostcodeFirstAddressInput
  id="pickup-address"
  label="Pickup Address - Enter Postcode First"
  value={null}
  onChange={(completeAddress) => {
    if (completeAddress) {
      updateFormData('step1', {
        pickupAddress: {
          address: completeAddress.displayText,
          city: completeAddress.components.city,
          postcode: completeAddress.components.postcode,
          coordinates: completeAddress.coordinates,
          houseNumber: completeAddress.propertyDetails.houseNumber || '',
          flatNumber: completeAddress.propertyDetails.flatNumber || '',
        }
      });
    }
  }}
  placeholder="Enter your postcode to start (e.g., SW1A 1AA)"
  required={true}
  error={errors['step1.pickupAddress.address']}
/>
```

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Test Postcodes (Real UK Postcodes)

1. **Central London**
   - `SW1A 1AA` - Buckingham Palace
   - `EC1A 1BB` - Barbican

2. **Manchester**
   - `M1 1AA` - City Centre

3. **Glasgow**
   - `G31 1DZ` - Example postcode
   - `G2 4JR` - City Centre

4. **Birmingham**
   - `B1 1AA` - City Centre

### Edge Cases to Test

1. **No Addresses Found**
   - Enter very rural/new postcode
   - System should show manual search option
   - User can search and select manually

2. **Single Address**
   - Enter postcode with only one property
   - Should display that address prominently
   - Quick selection flow

3. **Many Addresses (15+)**
   - Enter busy postcode (city center)
   - Scrollable list should appear
   - All addresses visible with scroll

4. **Invalid Postcode**
   - Enter "12345"
   - System should show error
   - Cannot proceed until valid

5. **Partial Postcode**
   - Enter "SW1A" (without second part)
   - Validation should fail
   - Hint to complete postcode

## 📱 Mobile Optimization

### Touch Targets
- Minimum 44px height for all interactive elements
- Larger padding on mobile (py={4})
- Full-width buttons for easy tapping

### Visual Adjustments
- Larger text on small screens
- Reduced spacing to fit content
- Simplified layouts on mobile
- Touch-friendly scroll areas

---

## 🔄 State Management

### Component State
```typescript
const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState<AddressStep>('postcode');
const [postcode, setPostcode] = useState('');
const [postcodeValidation, setPostcodeValidation] = useState(null);
const [selectedAddress, setSelectedAddress] = useState(null);
const [propertyDetails, setPropertyDetails] = useState({});
const [availableAddresses, setAvailableAddresses] = useState([]);
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
```

### Step Flow
```
postcode → address → details → complete
   ↓          ↓         ↓          ↓
  25%       50%       75%       100%
```

## 🎓 Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Always validate postcodes on both client and server**
2. **Cache API responses when possible** (5-minute cache)
3. **Provide fallback options** (manual search)
4. **Show clear error messages** with recovery options
5. **Optimize for mobile first** then enhance for desktop
6. **Test with real UK postcodes** not fake data

### For UX

1. **Minimize clicks** - one-click address selection
2. **Provide instant feedback** - loading states, success messages
3. **Show progress clearly** - step indicator at top
4. **Allow easy corrections** - edit/back buttons always visible
5. **Support keyboard navigation** - Enter key to continue
6. **Explain why** - clear messages about what happens next
