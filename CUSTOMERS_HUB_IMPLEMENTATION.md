**Audit Logging:**

- All customer actions are logged with actor information
- Detailed audit entries for refunds, credits, flags, and data exports
- Timestamp and IP tracking for compliance

### 5. Data Model Integration

**Customer Data Structure:**

```typescript
interface Customer {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  createdAt: string;
  emailVerified: boolean;
  stats: {
    totalOrders: number;
    completedOrders: number;
    cancelledOrders: number;
    totalLtv: number;
    openTickets: number;
    urgentTickets: number;
    addressesCount: number;
    contactsCount: number;
  };
  bookings: Array<Booking>;
  addresses: Array<Address>;
  contacts: Array<Contact>;
  supportTickets: Array<SupportTicket>;
}
```

**Related Models:**

- `User` - Customer base information
- `Address` - Saved customer addresses
- `Contact` - Emergency contacts
