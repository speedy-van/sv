## 4️⃣ **Distance & Duration Calculation** ✅

### **Problem:** 
booking-luxury wasn't saving distanceMeters/durationSeconds

### **Solution:**

#### A. **Database Schema Updated:**
```sql
✅ Added: distanceMeters INT
✅ Added: durationSeconds INT
✅ Added: pickupLat FLOAT
✅ Added: pickupLng FLOAT
✅ Added: dropoffLat FLOAT
✅ Added: dropoffLng FLOAT
```

#### B. **Backend Code Updated:**
**File:** `apps/web/src/app/api/booking-luxury/route.ts`

```typescript
// Lines 476-527: NEW CODE
✅ Calculates distance using Haversine formula
✅ Calculates duration (distance/speed + stops)
✅ Fallback geocoding if coordinates = 0
✅ Saves all fields to database
```

#### C. **Admin Orders API Fixed:**
**File:** `apps/web/src/app/api/admin/orders/route.ts`

```typescript
// Changed from select to include
✅ Returns ALL booking fields
✅ Includes distanceMeters, durationSeconds
✅ Includes coordinates
```

#### D. **Driver Jobs API Fixed:**
**File:** `apps/web/src/app/api/driver/jobs/route.ts`

```typescript
// Lines 137, 188: Type assertions added
✅ Uses saved distanceMeters first
✅ Uses saved durationSeconds first
✅ Fallback to calculation if missing
✅ Returns accurate data to mobile app
```

**All Events Working:**

### Admin → Driver Notifications:
```
✅ job-assigned
✅ job-removed
✅ order-removed
✅ job-cancelled

✅ schedule-updated
```

### Driver App Handles:
```
