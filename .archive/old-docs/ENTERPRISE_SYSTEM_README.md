# Enterprise-Grade Pricing & Workflow Architecture for Speedy Van

## üöÄ System Overview

This implementation represents a complete transformation of Speedy Van from a manual, tier-based system to a sophisticated, enterprise-grade platform that leverages dynamic pricing, performance-based payouts, and intelligent automation.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components

### 1. Dynamic Pricing Engine (DPE)
**Location**: `src/lib/pricing/dynamic-pricing-engine.ts`

The DPE replaces static pricing with intelligent, multi-variable calculations:

- **Core Job Factors**: Weight, volume, distance, fragility, special handling
- **Operational Factors**: Lane utilization, network capacity, time of day/week
- **Market Factors**: Fuel costs, weather, traffic, competitor pricing
- **Customer Factors**: Segment, service tier, lead time, loyalty discounts

**Key Features**:
- Real-time pricing calculation
- Multi-tier service levels (Economy, Standard, Premium)
- Confidence scoring
- Time-based quote expiration

### 2. Performance-Based Payout System
**Location**: `src/lib/pricing/payout-calculator.ts`

Revolutionary payout model that aligns driver incentives with business objectives:

**Components**:
- Route Base Fare: ¬£25 guaranteed per route
- Per-Drop Fees: ¬£8 per completed drop
- Mileage Component: ¬£1.20 per optimized mile
- Performance Multiplier: 0.8x - 1.5x based on KPIs

**Performance Metrics (Weighted)**:
- Customer Satisfaction (40%): Average rating 1-5 stars
- On-Time Performance (30%): Delivery within promised window
- First-Time Success Rate (20%): Successful completion without issues
- Asset & Route Compliance (10%): Adherence to optimized route

**Progressive Margin Sharing** (Replaces Hard Cap):
- ¬£0-¬£500: Company takes 30% of remaining margin
- ¬£501-¬£1000: Company takes 40%
- ¬£1001-¬£2000: Company takes 50%
- ¬£2001-¬£4000: Company takes 60%
- ¬£4001+: Company takes 70%

### 3. Automated Route Orchestration
**Location**: `src/lib/services/route-orchestration-service.ts`

Intelligent route optimization and driver assignment:

- Geographical clustering of drops
- Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) optimization
- Real-time capacity checking
- Automated driver assignment based on performance scores
- Dynamic re-routing for exceptions

### 4. Real-Time Driver Tracking
**Location**: `src/lib/services/driver-tracking-service.ts`

Advanced tracking and communication system:

- Real-time GPS location updates
- Status management (offline, available, on_route, break)
- Route progress monitoring
- Automated customer notifications
- Push notifications for drivers
- Performance analytics

### 5. Enterprise Admin Dashboard
**Location**: `src/components/admin/EnterpriseAdminDashboard.tsx`

Comprehensive operational control center:

- Real-time KPI monitoring
- Route optimization controls
- Driver performance analytics
- Customer satisfaction tracking
- System configuration management
