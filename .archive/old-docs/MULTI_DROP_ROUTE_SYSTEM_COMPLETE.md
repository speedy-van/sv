## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **Booking Creation** → BookingToDropConverter validates and converts to pending drops
2. **Route Orchestration** → Scheduler groups drops geographically every 12 minutes  
3. **Route Optimization** → Algorithm creates efficient delivery sequences
4. **Driver Assignment** → Routes distributed to available drivers via manifest
5. **Real-Time Tracking** → WebSocket broadcasts updates to all stakeholders
6. **Completion Handling** → Status updates propagate through system

### Service Tiers & Vehicle Capacity
- **Express**: 200kg, 1.0m³ (urgent/small items)
- **Small Van**: 500kg, 3.5m³ (standard deliveries)  
- **Large Van**: 1000kg, 7.0m³ (bulk orders)
- **Truck**: 2000kg, 15.0m³ (commercial/large items)

### Smart Route Optimization Algorithm 🧠
- **Intelligent Geographic Clustering**: Dynamic radius based on booking volume (25-125 miles)
- **Smart Radius Adaptation**: Automatically adjusts clustering distance based on demand intensity
- **Time Window Optimization**: Respects customer delivery preferences
- **Nearest Neighbor Sequencing**: Minimizes travel time between drops
- **Capacity Constraints**: Ensures routes fit vehicle limitations
- **Max Route Limits**: 12 drops per route, 8-hour maximum duration

#### 🎯 Smart Clustering Logic
```typescript
// Dynamic radius based on booking volume (UK miles standard)
function calculateSmartClusterRadius(totalBookings: number): number {
  if (totalBookings > 50) return 25;    // Busy periods - tight clustering
  if (totalBookings > 20) return 50;    // Moderate busy - balanced
  if (totalBookings > 10) return 75;    // Normal periods - moderate
  if (totalBookings > 5)  return 100;   // Quiet periods - wide coverage
  return 125;                           // Very quiet - maximum coverage
}
```
