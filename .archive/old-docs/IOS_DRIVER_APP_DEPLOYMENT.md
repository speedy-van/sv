## üìã Deployment Steps

### 1. Backend Deployment (Render/Vercel)

```bash
cd apps/web

# Ensure all changes committed
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Driver APIs - include driver relation, acceptanceRate, fix 403 error"

# Push to repository
git push origin main

# Render will auto-deploy
# Verify deployment: https://speedy-van.onrender.com/api/driver/profile
```

**Environment Variables to Check:**
- ‚úÖ `DATABASE_URL` - Neon PostgreSQL
- ‚úÖ `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
- ‚úÖ `NEXTAUTH_URL`
- ‚úÖ `PUSHER_APP_ID`
- ‚úÖ `PUSHER_KEY`
- ‚úÖ `PUSHER_SECRET`
- ‚úÖ `PUSHER_CLUSTER`

---

### 2. Mobile App Deployment (Expo/EAS)

```bash
cd mobile/expo-driver-app

# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install

# Update app.json version if needed
# "version": "1.0.1"

# Create EAS build (for production)
eas build --platform ios --profile production

# For development build with notifications
eas build --platform ios --profile development

# Submit to App Store (after build completes)
eas submit --platform ios
```

**Required Files:**
- [x] `app.json` - App configuration
- [x] `eas.json` - Build profiles
- [x] Apple Developer account credentials

---

## üß™ Post-Deployment Testing

### Backend API Tests:

```bash
# Set your production URL
BASE_URL="https://speedy-van.onrender.com"

# Test login
curl -X POST $BASE_URL/api/driver/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"test123"}'

# Save token from response
TOKEN="your_token_here"

# Test profile (should include driver relation)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  $BASE_URL/api/driver/profile

# Expected: { success: true, data: { driver: { id: "..." }, acceptanceRate: 100 } }

# Test performance (should not return 403)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  $BASE_URL/api/driver/performance

# Expected: { success: true, data: { acceptanceRate: 100, totalJobs: 0 } }

# Test jobs
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  $BASE_URL/api/driver/jobs

# Test routes
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  $BASE_URL/api/driver/routes
```
