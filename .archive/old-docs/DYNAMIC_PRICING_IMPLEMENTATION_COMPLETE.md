# Dynamic Pricing Implementation - Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive dynamic pricing system that allows administrators to adjust customer pricing and driver earnings rates through the admin dashboard.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema

- **New Table**: `PricingSettings`
  - `customerPriceAdjustment`: Decimal field (-1.00 to 1.00) for percentage adjustments
  - `driverRateMultiplier`: Decimal field (0.50 to 2.00) for driver earnings multiplier
  - `isActive`: Boolean to enable/disable settings
  - Audit fields: `createdBy`, `updatedBy`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
  - Proper indexing for performance

### 2. Admin Dashboard Interface

- **New Page**: `/admin/settings/pricing`
- **Features**:
  - Customer Price Adjustment Slider (-100% to +100%)
  - Driver Rate Multiplier Slider (0.5x to 2.0x)
  - Settings Status Toggle (Active/Inactive)
  - Real-time preview of adjustments
  - Example impact calculations
  - Form validation and error handling

### 3. API Endpoints

- **GET** `/api/admin/settings/pricing` - Retrieve current settings
- **POST** `/api/admin/settings/pricing` - Update settings with validation
- **Security**: Admin-only access with proper authentication

### 4. Pricing Engine Updates

- **Modified**: `computeQuote()` function in `engine.ts`
  - Now async to fetch current pricing settings
  - Applies customer price adjustments to subtotal
  - Includes adjustment percentage in breakdown
  - Maintains minimum/maximum price limits
  - Preserves VAT calculations

### 5. Driver Earnings Updates

- **Modified**: `calculateDriverEarnings()` function in `earnings.ts`
  - Applies driver rate multiplier to base rates
  - Adjusts minimum fare by multiplier
  - Maintains platform fee calculations
  - Preserves tip and surge calculations

### 6. Navigation Integration

- **Added**: Pricing settings link in admin navigation
- **Location**: Admin Settings → Pricing
- **Icon**: Dollar sign for easy identification

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Migration

```sql
-- New table created successfully
CREATE TABLE "PricingSettings" (
  "id" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "customerPriceAdjustment" DECIMAL(5,4) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  "driverRateMultiplier" DECIMAL(5,4) NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  "isActive" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  "createdAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  "updatedAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL,
  "createdBy" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "updatedBy" TEXT,
  PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);
```

### Pricing Calculation Flow

1. **Customer Pricing**:
   - Calculate base subtotal (base rate + distance + items + workers + stairs + extras)
   - Apply customer price adjustment if active: `subtotal * (1 + adjustment)`
   - Apply minimum/maximum limits
   - Add VAT if applicable

2. **Driver Earnings**:
   - Apply driver rate multiplier to base rates: `baseRate * multiplier`
   - Calculate earnings with adjusted rates
   - Apply minimum fare adjustment
   - Calculate platform fees on adjusted amounts

### Validation Rules

- **Customer Price Adjustment**: -100% to +100% (-1.00 to 1.00)
- **Driver Rate Multiplier**: 0.5x to 2.0x (0.50 to 2.00)
- **Settings Status**: Boolean (active/inactive)

## Usage Examples

### Customer Price Adjustments

- **+20% Increase**: £100 booking becomes £120
- **-10% Decrease**: £100 booking becomes £90
- **No Adjustment**: £100 booking remains £100

### Driver Rate Adjustments

- **1.2x Multiplier**: £2.50/mile becomes £3.00/mile
- **0.8x Multiplier**: £25/hour becomes £20/hour
- **1.0x Multiplier**: Standard rates maintained

## Testing Results

✅ **Database Schema**: Successfully created and migrated
✅ **Admin Interface**: Fully functional with real-time updates
✅ **API Endpoints**: Properly secured and validated
✅ **Pricing Engine**: Correctly applies adjustments
✅ **Driver Earnings**: Properly applies multipliers
✅ **Navigation**: Integrated into admin dashboard

## Security Features

- Admin-only access to pricing settings
- Input validation on all parameters
- Audit trail with user tracking
- Proper error handling and logging

## Performance Considerations

- Database queries optimized with indexes
- Settings cached in memory during calculations
- Async operations for database calls
- Timeout protection for external operations

## Future Enhancements

1. **Time-based Pricing**: Different rates for peak/off-peak hours
2. **Zone-based Pricing**: Different adjustments per service area
3. **Seasonal Pricing**: Automatic adjustments based on dates
4. **A/B Testing**: Compare pricing strategies
5. **Analytics Dashboard**: Track impact of pricing changes
